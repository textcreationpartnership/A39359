            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THough I am not of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That whoſoever writes a Book, ought to write a Preface (for ſome are ſo good that they need none, and ſome ſo bad that they don't deſerve one) yet I think my ſelf to lye under an obligation, to
<pb facs="tcp:109220:5"/> give the World an Account of thoſe Reaſons, which induced me to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a Book, which if it had its due deſerts, ought to be confined to ſilence and darkneſs for ever. 1. I might here alledge in the firſt Place, that the <hi>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus,</hi> has not as yet the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to receive an intire confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from any one Learned Hand, that I know in <hi>Europe.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Boyl</hi> in his little Body of Divinity, and almoſt all our Moderns, who have wrote in Vindication of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have taken notice of Divers of its dangerous poſitions, as they lye ſcattering up and down, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every page of it, from whence I might have leave to conclude, that if thoſe Learned men did think, that it was neceſſary to Anſwer the chief Objections, againſt the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures one by one; a Collective Anſwer to the whole Book,
<pb facs="tcp:109220:5"/> would be more ſatisfactory to the world, and more beneficial to the publick Good. And therefore I was not induced to undertake this task, becauſe I thought none could do it better, but becauſe none before me had began ſo uſeful a work. I conſider'd alſo in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, that moſt who have wrote upon this Subject, have either done it in ſuch a Philoſophical manner, as is not eaſily intelligible by the Vulgar, or have proceeded against him, and his Party, by ſuch Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Arguments, as tho very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet at most are but Conjectural, and therefore never can convince a ſtubborn <hi>Sceptiſt,</hi> tho they are very pleaſing to Ingenious Men. Now tho this way of Writing, is very tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whilſt the Argument is only toſs'd too and fro amongſt Learned Men, yet it is not ſufficient, when ſuch Deiſtical Principles begin to be Popular, and ſeize upon the minds
<pb facs="tcp:109220:6"/> of thoſe, who though they want Reaſon, yet ſtand in need of no Obſtinacy to defend the ſame. And therefore ſince this Book has, as I am informed, received lately ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in our own Language; I thought it might not be amiſs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the antidote, in the ſame vehicle, in which the Party has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Poyſon; and waving all Conjectural Arguments that are drawn from humane Authority, or whoſe force depends upon the knowledge of Books, or are too remote from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, to be underſtood by all Men; I have laid down chiefly ſuch Principles, as all may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and all who underſtand them muſt needs admit to be true: And I hope that it will be apparent from thence, That they who Renounce their Religion, into which they are Baptized, must Renounce their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too, which they boaſt to be
<pb facs="tcp:109220:6"/> their only guide. Nor am I igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the Author of this Book, was very well verſed (pardon ſo favourable an expreſſion) in the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; underſtood the Original Language, and had made a diligent ſearch, to find all weak places, wherein he might Aſſault and Ruine the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Fortreſs of Reveal'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> had another way of trifling with thoſe Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and wreſting ſome particular places to his odd Opinions: But this Author begins at the very Root and Foundation, by taking away all Divine Authority, from Prophecy, Miracles, or Inſpiration, and making all the ſacred Pen-men, to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than either Mad-men, or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. Now tho ſuch ſentiments, ought rather to be puniſhed by the Judge, than refuted by the Divine, yet ſince too much liberty has relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:109220:7"/> the Reins, both of Civil and Eccleſiastick Power, it is neceſſary that ſuch Weapons ſhould be uſed, as are therefore left us, becauſe they could not eaſily be taken away. And I thought it would be at leaſt ſome puniſhment, as it were, to the very Sbades and Manes of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to ſhew the world, that he, who ſo long has found a place in the Libraries and Hands of very Learned Men, does ſcarce for his ſtupidity, and trifling way of arguing, merit to obtain a place amongſt the loweſt forms of inferiour Animals: And I am ſure if he could ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion, his little Diſciples of the Town, can ſay a great deal leſs. But indeed the greateſt motive of all, was the general diſpoſition of men of all Degrees and Capacities in this Age, to ridicule our Religion as much as they can, nay, a great deal
<pb facs="tcp:109220:7"/> 
               <hi>farther than their own Abilities will give them leave.</hi> How will ſome <hi>Little People</hi> vent a Jeſt <hi>upon the Bible,</hi> or argue againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> who never read a Chapter in it, with that <hi>Attention which is due to thoſe Sacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> And never, <hi>even in their Younger Days,</hi> knew any thing beyond a <hi>Play</hi> or a <hi>Romance.</hi> I will not ſay, <hi>That too much Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty has given Opportunity to Deiſm, to grow up with thoſe other Weeds that infeſt this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Though if I ſhould, it might be found to appear not very unlibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe who conſider, that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Leviathan, <hi>was brought forth in the like times of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that this Author pleads for nothing more than Liberty to Exclude the Conſcientious Fear of God out of the World:</hi> But certain it is, <hi>That the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE PREFACE OF <hi>Tractatus Theologico Politicus.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere was not long ſince a young Gentleman, whoſe Name was <hi>Scepticus,</hi> who was pleaſed to retire from the noiſe of the <hi>Town,</hi> into the more refreſhing Solitude of the healthful Country. He was of a fiery Genius, always eager after new things, and moſt pleaſed with thoſe Thoughts, which he thought were fartheſt removed out of the Road of the Vulgar. He had began his Studies with a diligent Peruſal of the <hi>Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> Authors, from whom he received a deep
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109220:10"/> impreſſion of all thoſe Beauties, both of Thought and of Expreſſion, which are ſo viſibly Eminent in thoſe Antient Writers; from thence he proceeded to the Peruſal of the Moral VVritings of the Antient Philoſophers, but preſently taking a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt at Notions he thought too obvious and common, he flew from thence to the Atomical Philoſophy, as it ſtands revived by <hi>Des Cartes, Gaſſendus</hi> and others. This pleaſed him for a ſeaſon extreamly, becauſe it gave no deference to Authority, but let looſe the mind of man, to enjoy its primitive liberty of Thinking, and gave him vaſt Ideas of what mighty things might be done by mere Matter and Motion. But coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the VVorld, and finding that Religion was the grand Theme of all Mens diſcourſe, as well thoſe who lived according to its Rules, as thoſe who did not, he reſolved to apply his mind to ſearch into its abſtruſeſt Miſteries. And it happening at that time the <hi>Socinian</hi> Controverſie was revived with a great deal of heat, he applied his mind very diligently to read all the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Authors. He was a long time much pleaſed with their VVritings, becauſe they ſeemed to Interpret Scripture with an ayre and freedom, which he of all things moſt affected, and extoll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d Human Reaſon to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109220:10"/> ſuch a height, as was moſt agreeable to the Towring thoughts of his own Ambition. But finding at laſt, that thoſe VVriters had an excellent knack of making the Scriptures ſpeak whatſoever was agreeable to their own Sentiments; It bred in him an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Ingenuity of thoſe VVriters, but a contempt of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which he eaſily perceived, had no command over theſe Authors, whom he moſt admired. It was his misfortune at the ſame time to light upon the <hi>Tractatus Theologico Politicus,</hi> of <hi>Spinoſa.</hi> This turn'd him a perfect Deiſt, he threw away his Bible, and ſet up this Book in the room of it. He now thought himſelf to be ſet at liberty above the ſlaviſh condition of thoſe, who thought they were to be rul'd by their Bibles; and ſo fond was he of this Author, that every Summer, he carried him into the Fields with him in his hands, and each Winter he wore him in his Muff. There liv'd in the Neighbourhood an Old Grave Divine, who, in compaſſion to his Youth, did often pay this Young Man a Viſit; and had often been laugh'd at by him in the Pulpit, for his Zeal for Religion. He came to him one day in his Garden, as he was reading in this Author, and ſeem'd altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raviſh'd with the Entertainment; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109220:11"/> being well acquainted with him, was thus familiarly pleaſed to accoſt him.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Scept.</hi> That is beſt known by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <note place="margin">See the Pref. of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> where he firſt ſhews, <hi>That if Men lived always in Proſperity, and by their own good Conduct could become Masters of their moſt deſired Events, they would never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the vanity of Superſtition. But when they are driven into thoſe Straits, from which they cannot expedite themſelves, they are apt to believe any thing; the Mind is tumbled up and down between Hope and Fear, and not knowing where to reſt on Earth, looks up for a ſupport from Heaven; Implores the Deity with Tears diſgraceful to any Woman; runs after</hi> Augurs, South-ſayers, <hi>and</hi> Conjurers, <hi>and hunts for inſpiration, in Fools and Mad-men.</hi> An example of which he gives us in <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had in any difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his Prophers, as Servants of his Gods, but in proſperity forgot both them and their <hi>Maſters.</hi>

The <hi>Jews</hi> were never more <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> (if the <hi>Idolatrous Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> is Superſtition) than in their Higheſt Proſperity: For then they became aſhamed as it were of the Rites and Ceremonie: taught by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and grew ambitious of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valling their Neighbouring Nations, in all the Gallantry and Pageantry of their <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Worſhip.</hi> So that your admired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, by poring upon <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> for one ſingle Inſtance, has quite forgot the <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Examples</hi> to the contrary, which he might have found in almoſt every Leaf of the Bible, or Page of <hi>Livy's</hi> Hiſtory.</p>

               <hi>Scept.</hi> Don't tell me of <hi>Jews;</hi> I believe we know little of them, but what ſome Modern Impoſtors have convey'd to us; it is apparent to me, that all the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are driven to ſuperſtition by Fear only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Logic.</hi> Not ſo neither.

               <hi>Log.</hi> Yes, Sir, that I can, without tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over any large Volumes of Hiſtory: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a Fortunate Prince, and Great Conqueror; nor did I ever hear that he was very much a Coward; and yet he kept (ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 2.) ſeveral <hi>Nurſeries</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, Aſtrologers</hi> and <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret <hi>Dreams,</hi> predict <hi>Futurities,</hi> and inſtruct his Court and People in the <hi>ſuperſtitious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> of that Age and Nation.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Log.</hi> All Religion (which your <hi>A</hi>—calls Superſtition) does not take its Original from the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> but from the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. No man that is not perfectly mad, would Love, or Fear, or Worſhip a God, or any Inviſible Power, unleſs he was firſt fully perſuaded of the real Exiſtence of ſuch a Being or Beings, that can hurt, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him: For the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> tho never ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, could never hurry on a Man to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a What he thought to be a <hi>Non-ens,</hi> that had no Exiſtence but in his <hi>own Fancy.</hi> And this is the Reaſon, Why Beaſts, that are capable of <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> (or at leaſt ſomething very like <hi>thoſe Paſſions)</hi> are yet ſtrangers to all manner of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they have no <hi>praevious Notion</hi> of a Deity, to ſtir up thoſe <hi>Paſſions</hi> in them: Otherwiſe an Hare, that flies from all things, would be as <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander the Great,</hi> who made all to fly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scept.</hi> My Notion is, That it is the Fear of Mankind, vvorking violently upon the Underſtanding, that created all Notion of Inviſible Povvers.</p>

This is that Grand Cheat that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in all Ages have dreſs'd up in Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habits to pleaſe the Vulgar, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of a mutable Temper, and to keep them in ſubjection to thoſe Monarchs who want a Bridle to reſtrain unruly Subjects. But nothing is more fatal to a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> than too much of what you call <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> which is the Mother of Seditions and Tumults, and a great Enemy to a free Trade. And truly, this (I hope I ſpeak to a Friend) makes me very much wiſh we could ſee a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that we might enjoy the liberty of thinking and ſpeaking of Religion as we pleas'd, which now is too much reſtrain'd.

               <hi>Commonwealths</hi> call in the help of Oaths, to bind their Subjects to Allegiance, as well as <hi>Monarchs?</hi> And may not Diviſions about Religion, that cauſe Seditions, as well ariſe where this Liberty is, as where there is none?

Beſides, your Author ſeems to me to be very ignorant in Hiſtory, when he would confine Religion to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as <hi>Storks</hi> are ſaid by Nature to be confin'd to a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> For never did Superſtition flouriſh more than in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> and others, whilſt they were under a <hi>Republican Government;</hi> which gave occaſion to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Reproof to the <hi>Athenians; I perceive that in all things you are too ſuperſtitious.</hi> And yet the Subjects of both, were as glorious for Arms
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109220:15"/> and Learning, as any of our <hi>Modern Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi> I muſt confeſs, as for what you ſay, that Religion is an Enemy to Free Trade, is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, becauſe it takes away from Trade, the freedom of lying, and cheating, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding, which ſome perhaps think eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it: But if you Gentlemen deſire a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> that you may barter away our Religion for a Free Trade, I ſay, pray God bleſs the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

               <hi>Scep.</hi> Prithee don't think we deſire to take away your Religion: Your <hi>Reaſon</hi> ought to be your Only Religion, and that I am ſure no man deſires to take from you. My Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Deſign is only to take off thoſe Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices which the Vulgar entertain of the Scriptures, who deſpiſe <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and think that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the <hi>Only Oracles of Truth</hi>—In order to this my Author promiſes to demonſtrate, <hi>That Prophecy, or Revelation, is nothing elſe but ſtrength of Fancy. That the Ancient Prophets were only Men of a ſtrong I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, and of a weak Reaſon. That the Divine Law is nothing elſe but fatal Neceſſity. That Miracles are only thoſe Works of Nature of whoſe Cauſe we are ignorant. That the true way of interpreting thoſe Books you call Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, does ſhew that they are of Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and that every individual man has a Right and Authority to interpret Scripture as he pleaſes.

               <hi>A.</hi> Well then: Mind the Conſequence: All Natural Knowledge may properly be called <hi>Propheſie;</hi> for thoſe things which we know by Natural Light, depend upon the ſole knowledge of God, and his Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: But our Mob-Divines, that ſtand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with their Mouths open to Heaven, to catch <hi>Wonders,</hi> exclude Natural Reaſon from Prophecy; as if the one deſcended from Heaven, and the other ſprang from Earth onely: And yet humane reaſon is Divine,

               <hi>The.</hi> And Pray Sir, what Charms can you ſee in ſuch a Jargon of Diſcourſe, as ſhould draw your minds away one ſtep from reveal'd Religion? For here is a very abſurd confuſion of Natural Knowledge, and that which proceeds from Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. No Man that apprehends the neceſſary Connexion of two Terms, was ever yet call'd a Prophet, by any but this <hi>A.</hi>—If Natural Knowledge might proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called Propheſy, then every Man that by his Natural Reaſon, could comprehend all the neceſſary Properties of a Triangle, or the undoubted certainty of Mathematical Axioms; or thoſe ſelf-evident Propoſitions, which are known by a bare perception of the Terms, would be a Prophet; and ſo not only () all the Lord's People would be Prophets, but all the Devil's People too; for as much as ſome Propoſitions, by the ſole Light of Reaſon, are evident to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You miſtake my Author; for he tells you, page 2. <hi>That tho Natural Knowledge is Divine, yet the Teachers of it cannot be called

The very <hi>Magicians</hi> could ſay, when they ſaw <hi>Lice</hi> miraculouſly produced by <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Rod,</hi> That <hi>this was the very Finger of God;</hi> becauſe they knew it was not within the Bounds of the Power of Nature, and that it could not be done by thoſe Inferior In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109220:18"/> Powers, which they invoked. And the Prophets call their inſpired Writings, <hi>The Word of the Lord,</hi> becauſe not deduced from the ſetled Courſe and Order of things, but delivered to them immediately by God himſelf; in reſpect to which it is called by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Sure Word of Prophecy.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> What do you infer from hence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.</hi> That your Author trifles, when he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals Humane Reaſon to Divine Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaying very boldly, That <hi>(Aequali jure, ac alia (cognitio) quaecunque illa ſit, divina vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari poteſt)</hi> when it is evident, That the one is founded on the Natural Order of things, and therefore ſubject to thoſe Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are common to all the Works of Nature: The other comes immediately from God, and has no imperfection in it. Our Reaſon, tho firſt given us by God, yet is corrupted by our ſelves: The Idolatry and Superſtition of the firſt Ages of the World, do abundantly ſhew how much Natural Reaſon is ſubject to be led aſide into Error, by Senſe, Paſſion, Intereſt and Example, in the things that belong unto God: There is a Light of Nature, but it is no more than a glimmering Light, which diſcovers ſome, but not all things, that are neceſſary to be known, ſo clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly as may make it compleatly benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to Mankind. Beſides, it is often darkned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109220:18"/> by Inadvertency, Luſt, and Male-Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of the Body, and a thouſand other Impediments: But <hi>Revelation</hi> is ſuch an impreſſion upon the Mind of the Prophets, as gives a diſcovery of ſomething unknown before; for to reveal, is to detect ſomething that before was cover'd, and always creates a threefold certainty in all inſpired Authors: 1. It renders them ſure that it is God who ſpeaks to them; <hi>2dly,</hi> That they rightly apprehend what he means: <hi>3dly,</hi> That whatever he reveals, is infallibly ſure; For that <hi>God will not deceive,</hi> is the very <hi>Baſis</hi> of all Humane, and of all Divine Knowledg. Your Author therefore very truly aſſerts, <hi>That Revelation exceeds the Bounds of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon,</hi> becauſe it extends it ſelf to the hidden things of God, <hi>viz.</hi> The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a future Happineſs, and the ways and means by which we may gain the ſame; as alſo, becauſe it cannot be cauſed by the regular Order of Nature, but muſt proceed immediately from God; but then he very abſurdly endeavours to equal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon to it, when in the ſame breath he confeſſed, that it is exceeded by Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You talk of Certainty in Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; but for my part, I have no Idea, how a Mortal Man can be certain what or when God ſpeaks to him.</p>

               </gap> complex Idea, as ſignifying the diſcovery of ſomething made unto Man, by the immediate Power of God, we can have no diſtinct Knowledge of its manner of producing Certainty in the Mind of Man, unleſs all the ſimple I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's, which compound the ſame, extend into our Underſtanding, by our Senſes, or were obvious to it by a ſimple intuition: But the Manner of God's ſpeaking to Man by Revelation, being altogether Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it cannot be compleatly underſtood by thoſe, who have had only Experience of the uſe of Natural Faculties. Suppoſe a Man born into the World with a Sixth Senſe, whereby he could diſcern the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Differences of External things, it would not follow, that becauſe other men had not a compleat Idea, how he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the differences of things, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had no perception at all. A man ſo framed by God, might have clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perception, and yet not be able by any force of Words, to make his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours underſtand the manner of it. For the Words that now are, do ſignifie ſome I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's which have already been common to Mankind; but where the thing it ſelf was always unknown, there Words, whoſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification extends no further than to things that are already known, can never explain
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109220:19"/> them to us. A man that never had the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Illumination of a Prophetick Spirit, can no more have a compleat Idea of what it is, than a blind man can have of Colours; he may be taught by rote to give definitions, but all the definitions that can be given, will never give him the true Idea of Light or Colour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Then Prophetical Light is ſomething, but you don't know what.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.</hi> Yes, We know as much of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Divine Revelation, as is neceſſary for us to know; and he that enquires after more, ought not to be gratify'd in his need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs curioſity. We know from the Nature of God, and the Conſtitutiou of our own Souls, that it is not impoſſible for God to communicate his Will and Pleaſure to whomſoever he pleaſes; for it would be ſtrange indeed, if God, who made the Soul capable of underſtanding every thing elſe, ſhould not be able to make it capable of underſtanding himſelf, whenever he ſhould vouchſaſe to ſpeak to it. For why ſhould not Man be as capable of knowing when God ſpeaks to him in a ſupernatural way, as when his Neighbour ſpeaks to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſual courſe of Cuſtom and Nature. All things are poſſible with God, that do not imply a contradiction in the Terms, or are not directly repugnant to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109220:20"/> the eſſential Purity of the Divine Nature; but it is no more a contradiction (tho more unuſual) for God to ſpeak to Man, than it is for one Man to ſpeak to another; nor is it repugnant to the Divine Purity, to teach Man his Will, to obey which is Man's ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perfection. We alſo know, from as Authentick Records of Antiquity, as any are now extant, That ſome Men, Eminent for Wiſdom, Learning and Vertue, have affirmed, That God has ſpoken to them; and we have Reaſon enough to believe that they were certain of it, becauſe they expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Lives and Fortunes, and all that is dear to Fleſh and Blood, in compliance to the Doctrines they receiv'd from God: and that no room might be left for doubt, the ſame God that thus ſpake to them, gave them power to do ſuch things, as quite ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the power of Nature, and to foretel ſuch Events, as were not poſſible to be gueſs'd at by any humane Underſtanding. If therefore we, who by Faith believe the Doctrines taught by theſe inſpired Authors, are deceived, we are deceived by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who alone could give ſuch Gifts of Prophecy and Miracles to the Sons of Men: And if our Faith is deceived by God, we know not but that our Reaſon is deceived too: For if God can deceive in one, why may we not think he may do it in the other?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109220:20"/> And then our A—is ſo far from being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to get the Victory, by ſuch Diſputes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Revealed Religion, that he cannot be certain that he diſputes at all.</p>

From whence he infers, That the Certainty of Prophecy is not Mathematical, but only Moral; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to thoſe Principles, nothing but a Fanciful Whimſey, that may as well be falſe or true. Now by this Author's leave, no ſuch concluſion; nor indeed can any concluſion at all be drawn from the Mediums of Divine Revelation, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Certainty or Fallibility of it: For
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109220:22"/> all the Mediums of Revelation being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, we may call 'em by what Names we pleaſe; yet ſtill we muſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thoſe Names from ſome Natural Things, becauſe of thoſe only we have compleat Idea's. He that is a Prophet, muſt be certain it is God who ſpeaks to him, but the bare hearing of a Voice, or the ſeeing of an Image, will not create this Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to the Laws of Nature: For Voices and Words may be framed by other inviſible Powers; and therefore we are not ſo fooliſh as to conclude that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Prophet of God, becauſe he heard a Voice, or ſaw a Figure, but becauſe he was enabled to ſhew forth ſenſible Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the power of God was with him. But tho we do not conclude the certainty of Revelation from the Mediums of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo is it the greateſt madneſs in the World, to infer from thence the Uncertainty of it: For we who have not ſeen thoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, nor heard thoſe Words, nor felt thoſe Divine Impreſſions, can frame no compleat Idea's of them. And your bold Author draws Concluſions from ſuch Premiſes, which 'tis plain he could never underſtand, unleſs he can pretend that himſelf has been inſpired. Suppoſing it therefore true, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preter haec nulla alia ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda,</hi> &amp;c. p. 7.</note> the Scripture made mention of no other Mediums of Revelation than Signs, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109220:23"/> and Words, yet cannot he from thence infer any Neceſſity of the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Divine Revelation, unleſs he could give us compleat Idea's of what manner of Impreſſions thoſe Words, or Signs, made upon the Minds of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; Which is a matter impoſſible for him to teach, or us to learn. One Man can inform another of his Mind, by Words and Figures, and why muſt God be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from that power which he gives his Creature? But after all, it is not true, that Words and Figures are the only Mediums of Divine Revelation, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mention. There is a Communication of the Spirit of God, immediately infuſing Knowledge into the Mind, without any Organs of Speech, or Corporeal Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; which yet is as infallible as the other. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 17. Our Saviour promiſes his Diſciples, <hi>That the Spirit of Truth ſhould lead them into all Truth:</hi> And this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Spirit we call <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> uſing a Metaphorical Word to expreſs a Notion, which we cannot poſſibly receive from the bare knowledge of Nature. And tho this Spirit appear'd to the Apoſtles, <hi>(Acts</hi> 2.) in the ſhape of <hi>Cloven Tongues,</hi> yet we read it beſtowed upon them, and upon others in the Primitive Times, the <hi>Gift of Drivers Languages,</hi> before utterly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109220:23"/> unknown unto them, by a ſecret and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Operation. If therefore the Spirit of God can reveal to the Mind of Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of thoſe Mediums, the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Words; why may it not alſo, after the ſame, or any other manner, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the certain knowledge of Things, which is all we contend for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I wonder you will mention the Spirit of God, which our Author ſhews, is a Word of Various, and conſequently dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſignification. The Scripture-Phraſe, <hi>That the Spirit of God is in the Prophets; That Men are filled with the Spirit of God;</hi> and the like, does ſignifie no more, than that the Prophets were good Men, and that they perceiv'd the Will of God, as all Men (tho perhaps in a leſs degree, muſt needs do by the Light of Nature.) But all this is but the Imagination of the Prophet, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with relation to the Apprehenſions of the Vulgar: And pray, Sir, what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is there in bare Imagination?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.</hi> If by <hi>Imagination</hi> you underſtand the Power of the Mind, to receive, retain, or frame the Images of External Objects, it may be conſidered with relation to things preſent, paſt, or to come. External Objects, when preſent, impreſs ſuch Vivid Images upon the Brain, as will not ſuffer the Mind to doubt of their real Exiſtence. The ſame
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109220:24"/> Certainty (tho ſomething ſhort of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,) is left upon the Mind, by Objects repreſented to the Senſes, when the Objects themſelves are paſt and gone. He that ſees an Horſe or Elephant preſent, by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges impreſſed on the Brain, knows that they are preſent, and by reflecting on the ſame Images the next day, he knows that they were preſent: And thus far Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a certain Repoſitory of Knowledge; though not altogether infallible, becauſe through defect of the Organs, (as in Mad Men) the Images framed by the Mind it ſelf, are apprehended as exiſting without it; but thoſe who are in their Wits, are never impos'd upon by their Imaginations after that manner, as to think they hear Voices, when they hear none; or ſee Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of things, that are not near them. Men thus deluded by Imagination, always ſhew ſigns of the Diſtemper, in inconſiſtency of Thought, and wild Rovings of Expreſſion, which I defie any man to obſerve in the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, tho ſome things therein are hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and may ſeem uncouth to us, by reaſon of long diſtance of Times, Ignorance of the Cuſtoms, Hiſtories and Language of thoſe Times, and many other Reaſons, which I forbear to mention, as obvious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without it. In ſhort, either God did
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109220:24"/> ſend Meſſages to his Servants the Prophets, by the viſible appearance of Angels, and ſpake to them in Voices, or their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fram'd all theſe Appearances to it ſelf, from the ſhatter'd Images of other Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Objects. If the firſt of theſe is true, your Author very impertinently concludes the Uncertainty of Prophecy from the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Imagination; for that Faculty does faithfully enough receive and preſerve the Images of things really preſented to it; and herein the Certainty of Imagination differs not from the Certainty of our Senſes. If he means the latter, the Prophets then were no better than Pious Mad Men, and all the Sacred Writings are mere Fictions of the Mind, which owe all the little Truth that is in them, to meer Chance, which I perceive, however diſguiſed, is the genuine meaning of your admired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But if <hi>Moſes</hi> and the other Prophets, were diſtemper'd by a leſs Imagination, how comes it to paſs, that they are all ſo conſtant in the Doctrine of Piety? For I am ſure our Modern Mad Men (who are never conſiſtent with themſelves, or one another,) are very much different from his deſcription of the Ancients: Or how come their Predictions to be verified by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? Or how come the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſuch Fools as to follow Mad
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109220:25"/> Men? Or how did ſuch a Mad Man as <hi>Moſes,</hi> attain the power of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and of leading the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Wilderneſs, and governing them with Prudence and Moderation? But if God himſelf made theſe Revelations to them, it is nonſenſe to infer any uncertainty for the Mediums God uſes for the Work; For it is in his Power to create Certainty of Divine Revelation, without the help of Mediums, as in the caſe of Inſpiration, or by whatſoever means he pleaſes, as thoſe of Words of Figures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You know very well, that the Mind can compound various Images, and thence conclude more Propoſitions than can be known by deductions from the ſole Light of Reaſon; and thence it is the Prophets teach more of Religion than can be known by Nature only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.</hi> The true Reaſon is this: God knows more than Man, what is neceſſary to make him happy; and therefore thoſe who are taught by God, can declare more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means of Salvation, than thoſe who are guided by the ſole Light of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Well, ſtill I have ſome Reaſon to think, that Prophecy was the pure Work of the Imagination. 1. The Prophets per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and uttered all things by Parables and Riddles, expreſſing Spiritual things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109220:25"/> a Corporal manner. 2. It was, as Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination always is, very inconſtant, not adhering to the Prophet, but coming by fits and ſtarts, according to the unſteddy leaps of Fancy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.</hi> But I have better Reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me, that your Author is in a moſt egregious error for futurities; <hi>i. e.</hi> things which neither are, nor have been, cannot make impreſſion upon the Fancy, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of Nature, which may produce any tolerable degree of Certainty; and therefore when Futurities are foretold, which depend not upon any neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of natural cauſes, it muſt be aſſerted by the ſupernatural Power of God. The Mind may indeed be impos'd upon by help of the Imagination, ſeveral ways, in reſpect to things to come; as when from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what is paſt, it concludes that the ſame will happen again, tho there be no neceſſary connexion between the Cauſe and the Effect: Or, (2.) When from its vaſt Magazine of Images, it chuſes out, and joyns thoſe together, which ought not to be joyned, and concludes their future Exiſtence, from an ill conceived Notion of their bare poſſibility of Being. And herein the Mind frequently impoſes upon its ſelf, by its own Paſſions and Deſires, concluding ſuch things will be, which it moſt deſires

But ſuch poſſible and impoſſible compoſitions of the Fancy, or concluſion of the deluded Reaſon of Mankind, are of ſo vaſt a number, that it is impoſſible all, or any great number of them ſhould prove true, without the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were made by God himſelf. How could <hi>Imagination,</hi> out of thouſands of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Circumſtances of our Saviour's Birth, pick out all thoſe by the Prophets, which would certainly come to paſs, as we can eaſily prove from <hi>the holy Scriptures?</hi> or how could it avoid predicting ſomething that was falſe, if it had only <hi>probability</hi> to work upon, which is the only Object of Fancy, in regard to future Events, which never made any impreſſion upon it? We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude the <hi>certainty of Prophecy,</hi> not from the Nature of Imagination, but from the knowledg and power that God has, to make whatſoever <hi>impreſſions he pleaſes upon it.</hi> And tho the <hi>Prophets</hi> frequently did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and ſpeak by <hi>corporal repreſentations</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual matters,</hi> that might very well be preſum'd to be done, in compliance to <hi>the apprehenſions of the people,</hi> who at that time were very ignorant, ſtanding more in need of <hi>Milk</hi> than of robuſter diet. And tho God did declare <hi>his mind,</hi> as one man may to another, by <hi>Hieroglyphick Repreſentations,</hi> yet thoſe never diſturb'd the Reaſon of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109220:26"/> Prophet, nor cauſed him to entertain <hi>groſs conceptions</hi> of God. Fancy let looſe, makes ſuch a Medly of Religion, as may be found in the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> of <hi>Ovid,</hi> or the <hi>Iliads</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> or the <hi>Remains</hi> of <hi>Orpheus;</hi> but it cannor produce ſuch a regular Structure of Divine Doctrine, and ſo agreeable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, as is contain'd in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Goſpel of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But why did they not prophecy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways?</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe Man is a free Agent, and can ſpeak to his Neighbour when he pleaſes, or can let it alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.</hi> And ſo is God, who does not ſend all men to be <hi>Meſſengers of his Will,</hi> but ſome only, choſen out of Mankind for ſo great a work. Nor does he chuſe to ſpeak always to them, but at ſuch <hi>times and ſeaſons as pleaſes him.</hi>

                  <hi>T.</hi> SIR, You ſeem very much pleaſed: I hope you receiv'd ſome ſatisfaction by my laſt diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It bore ſome Face of Reaſon at firſt appearance, but my Author has furniſhed me with ſome <hi>New Objections,</hi> which I fear, with all your <hi>Prieſt-craft,</hi> you will never be able to anſwer. You talk of <hi>Prophets,</hi> as <note place="margin">p. 15.</note> Great Men inſpired by God, when it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that their Minds were as far inferior to other Mens, as Reaſon is ſuperior to Fancy. <hi>Solomon</hi> was a wiſe man, but no Prophet. We muſt not therefore ſeek the knowledge either of human or divine things from the <hi>Writings of Prophets, i. e.</hi> of Men led by Fancy, but <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who are guided by Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T.</hi> That is, from Men taught by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not taught by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If a man was ſure that theſe <hi>Prophets were taught by God,</hi> he would deſire to have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109220:27"/> no better <hi>Maſters:</hi> But alas! they were not certain of their own Inſpiration, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation it ſelf, but ſome other <hi>little ſign,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to their human Education, Opinion, or pre-conceiv'd knowledg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T.</hi> If they perceiv'd the Will of God by Imagination (which are the words of your Author), and yet remain'd doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of it, then it follows either that God was not willing, or not able to give them aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that himſelf ſpake to them. If you ſay, he was not willing, you contradict the <hi>Teſtimonies of Scripture,</hi> by which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at firſt you would be judged, and you ſubvert all Fundamentals of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which teaches nothing more plainly, than that <hi>God cannot deceive.</hi> If you ſay, he was willing, but not able, you muſt deny him to have that power, which is not only contain'd in the Idea of a Deity, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the other <hi>works of his hands.</hi> The <hi>Prophets</hi> therefore doubted not but it was God who ſpake to them, tho they <hi>ſometimes required a ſign,</hi> to confirm the truth of ſome Promiſe made to their Poſterity; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 8. where <hi>Abraham</hi> required not a ſign, that he might be certain it was God that ſpake to him (for if he had not been well aſſured <note place="margin">Act. 7. 3.</note> of that, we cannot think he would have left his Father's houſe, to ſojourn in <hi>Canaan,</hi> in Obedience to a Divine Command, as we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109220:28"/> read in the 12th Chap.) but that he might thereby aſſure his Poſterity of the Promiſe, to engage them to a nearer and ſtricter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with their God. Or perhaps <hi>Abraham</hi> was deſirous by ſome farther Revelation, accompany'd by a ſign, to know ſomething more particular concerning the Time, and other <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> of <hi>his Poſterity's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Land of Canaan,</hi> which God vouchſafed to give him, as we read in the latter part of the ſame chap. But your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor trifles, when he infers from this 15th ch. of <hi>Gen.</hi> that the <hi>Patriarch required a ſign, that he might be certain the Promiſe was made by God himſelf;</hi> ſince it is evident from v. 6. that <hi>he believed in God, and it was accounted unto him for righteouſneſs,</hi> before the ſign there mentioned was given to him. As for <hi>Judges</hi> 6. we read, that <hi>Gideon was inform'd by an Angel, in the ſhape of a Man, that he ſhould free Iſrael from the Midianitiſh ſlavery, of which at firſt he doubted; but after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the food he brought by fire, and the diſappearance of the heavenly Miniſter, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was an Angel of God.</hi> But what is this to your Author's purpoſe? Suppoſe the certainty of one or two <hi>Revelations</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a ſign, does it thence follow, as he wildly concludes, <hi>that no Prophet could he ſure of a Divine Revelation without a ſign?</hi> Do we not read of <hi>many Divine Revelations,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109220:28"/> of the truth of which the <hi>Prophets</hi> never doubted, wherein there was no ſign given, but the certainty aroſe from the perſpicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Revelation it ſelf. God does not confine himſelf to any one way of ſpeaking to Mankind, but <hi>(Heb. 1. 1.) in diverſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets.</hi> Sometimes indeed, as in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Gideon,</hi> the perſon to whom God by his <hi>Angel</hi> appeared, was not at firſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it was God, till by further illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and repeated <hi>ſigns and wonders,</hi> he was ſuffered no longer to doubt of it. When <note place="margin">Numb. 3. Act. 7. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt ſaw the <hi>Buſh burning with fire, and the Buſh not conſumed, he turned aſide to behold it,</hi> as a ſtrange ſight; and when <hi>God ſent his Angels to</hi> Abraham, <hi>he took them at firſt ſight for Men, and made accordingly proviſion for their reception;</hi> and when <hi>God called twice unto</hi> Samuel, <hi>he ſuppoſed it was the voice of Ely:</hi> And yet he made afterwards ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of himſelf, to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thoſe <note place="margin">See <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 2, 8, 9, 14. ver.</note> other good men, that they wanted no ſign to be themſelves aſſured of his preſence, but rather to convict others, that they were ſent by God. We don't ſay, that God, by every <hi>appearance of an Angel to the Sons of Men,</hi> darted an infallible certainty into their <hi>Minds,</hi> that left no room for <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> but that he could do ſo whenſoever he pleaſed, as is evident by Reaſon; and that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109220:29"/> he did frequently do ſo, as is no leſs plain from the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and that he added ſometimes <hi>Signs,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of thoſe to whom the <hi>Revelations</hi> were made, (for, with the <hi>Jews,</hi> we will not call them all <hi>Prophets),</hi> and ſometimes he added none, when the perception was clear enough without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Is not <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> ſuperior then to <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſince that is ſupported by <hi>Signs,</hi> and the other perſpicuous enough without it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T.</hi> The conſequence is vain and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The ſubſtance of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true by the light of Nature, yet it was confirmed to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> at its moſt remarkable promulgation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. God therefore by confirming Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light by <hi>Signs and Wonders,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Author, did that which was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, As if the unlearned, obſtinate, or unthinking part of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtood in no need of being rous'd up as it were to <hi>Natural Duties,</hi> by <hi>Supernatural Signs and Wonders:</hi> Or as if the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> by addition of <hi>Miracles,</hi> became inferior to the very ſame <hi>Laws,</hi> without any ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is altogether as true as that 4 and 2 is leſs than 4. As for <hi>Duties</hi> which are known by <hi>Revelation only,</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Supper of our Lord)</hi> when
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109220:29"/> once they are made known, by <hi>ſupernatural methods,</hi> they no ways give place to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Law of Nature, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>branches</hi> of that general Obedience to God, which is the adequate Law of human Nature. When God bid <hi>Abraham</hi> ſacrifice his Son, he was as much obliged to kill him, as he was obliged before that Command to preſerve his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I won't diſpute with you about <hi>ſmall matters,</hi> but this is evident, that <hi>Signs</hi> were <note place="margin">p. 18.</note> given to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> according to their pre-conceiv'd Opinions, and their different Capacities: ſo that the ſame ſign which render'd one Prophet certain of divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, would have wrought no ſuch effect upon another. If their Temper was ſanguine, they fancied nothing but <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, Victories, Meſſiahs, Peace and Plenty:</hi> If their blood was vitiated with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly humors, they dream'd of <hi>Wars, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Blood and Devaſtations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> The ſign was, for the moſt part, the power of working ſome ſupernatural effect, given to the Prophet, to convince rather others, than himſelf, that he was ſent by God, and delivered his Meſſage to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and becauſe all Mankind have not the ſame temperature of body, nor labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame <hi>prejudices of Education,</hi> nothing can be a ſufficient ſign, but what is ſo far
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109220:30"/> above the ordinary works of Nature, that Men of all <hi>Temperatures,</hi> and all <hi>Opinions</hi> too, if they are in their Senſes, muſt needs confeſs, that <hi>it is the immediate work of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior inviſible power.</hi> Upon this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we raiſe the certainty of the <hi>Moſaick,</hi> and of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> Let any man, of what <hi>Temperature,</hi> and poſſeſs'd with what <hi>Prejudices</hi> you pleaſe, provided he be not ſtark mad, (for <hi>Bethlem</hi> is to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all <hi>Diſputations)</hi> conſider what <hi>Moſes</hi> did in the ſight of all the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did in all parts of <hi>Judea,</hi> and let him then perſwade himſelf, or others, that all this was done, or poſſible to be done, by the ordinary courſe and power of Nature. If he can do that, we will yeild our Cauſe, and confeſs our Religion was never confirmed by <hi>Signs</hi> from Heaven; for Effects that may be, or may not be Natural, may be ſome <hi>Indications,</hi> but <hi>no Demonſtrations of a ſuperior inviſible power.</hi> The truth is, the Sparks of your Principles, were never, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſo mad as to confeſs the <hi>truth of all thoſe mighty works,</hi> recorded to have been done by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> himſelf, and yet doubt of their divine Miſſion; for I preſume every man who believes our Saviour to have <hi>raiſed himſelf,</hi> or <hi>others from the Grave,</hi> muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109220:30"/> believe his <hi>divine Miſſion:</hi> And as for the <hi>minor Prophets,</hi> their <hi>Meſſages</hi> being of <hi>leſs extent,</hi> and <hi>leſs conſequence to mankind,</hi> there was no neceſſity that all of them ſhould have their <hi>Commiſſion ſign'd from Heaven,</hi> and <hi>recorded to poſterity,</hi> by the ſame number and perſpicuity of <hi>ſupernatural Wonders,</hi> as was that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Your Author therefore very impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and ignorantly too, aſſerts, <hi>that the Sign was adapted to the Temperature, or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or Imagination of the Prophet;</hi> when it was always ſome ſupernatural work, adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to convince the Reaſon of all Mankind, and impoſſible to be gain-ſay'd by any.</p>

Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> being impatient of Life, was enabled to foretel dreadful tidings to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Ez. 3. 14. Jeremiah</hi> was a melancholy, and conſequently a continual Meſſenger of Evil to his brethren: <hi>Micah</hi> troubled with the ſame diſeaſe, always propheſied dreadful Events to <hi>Ahab;</hi> which plainly ſhews, that <hi>Prophecy did much depend upon the natural Temperature of the body.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> No more than my ſending a merrily diſpos'd Servant upon an Errand, does ſhew
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109220:31"/> that my Errand was an effect of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine complexion of my Servant's Body. God, who knows the Diſpoſition and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of all human Bodies, may chuſe thoſe that are beſt adapted for each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Meſſage he ſends to Mankind; but that is no Argument, that the Meſſage it ſelf is any effect of their <hi>natural diſpoſition.</hi> For we are not ſo mad as to believe theſe Men were inſpired, becauſe they ſpake of <hi>things agreeable to their own humours,</hi> but <hi>things above the reach of humane knowledge. Eliſha</hi> might diſpel ſome melancholy Fumes, by the harmony of Muſick, but I would feign know the Name of that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtrument, which could inſpire his mind with the knowledge of thoſe two futurities. 1. <hi>That the ditches ſhould be filled with water, without any preceeding rain. 2.

                  <hi>the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>ſhould overcome their Enemies. Moſes</hi> was angry with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he foretold the deſtruction of all the firſt born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but it was not <hi>his Anger,</hi> but God himſelf, or one of his <hi>Angels,</hi> that <hi>at midnight ſmote all the firſt born of the land of Egypt, Ex. 12. 20. Micah</hi> always propheſied Evil to <hi>Ahab,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ahab</hi> always was an ill man, and there was evil decreed againſt him by God, which accordingly came to paſs, not by <hi>Micah's indignation,</hi> but <hi>by the just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</hi> If theſe mens predictions had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109220:31"/> been an effect of bodily temper, (and if your Author ſays not that, he ſays not one word to the purpoſe) they muſt frequently have been proved falſe by the Event: For Truth is ſeldom ſeen, much leſs foreſeen, by thoſe who ſpeak and act according to the unſteady motions of bodily temper. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is clearer than the Light, that theſe <hi>inſpired Authors did not propheſie,</hi> as your Author inſinuates, <hi>according to their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> but according to what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Spirit of God. The <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> bear witneſs, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a very <hi>meek man;</hi> and therefore, according to your Author's ſilly <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> all <hi>Revelations</hi> proceeding through him, ſhould have been full of nothing but <hi>Meekneſs and Gentleneſs,</hi> and the Sanctions ſhould have conſiſted chiefly of alluring promiſes; and yet we Read in <hi>Exod. 20. That the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>was delivered in a terrible manner, by Thunder and Lightning in the Mount.</hi> And <hi>Deut. 28. 15. Moſes</hi> utters ſo many Curſes againſt the tranſgreſſor of the Law, as muſt needs proceed from ſomething ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much different from the deſcription he gives of his own meek and gentle Spirit. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> will be allowed by your Author, to have been a perſon of a fierce diſpoſition, as may be ſeen by his <hi>calling for Fire down from Heaven, upon the Captains of Fifties,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109220:32"/> and killing the Worſhippers of Baal;</hi> and from our Saviour's rebuke to his Diſciples, when they would have had him call down for <hi>Fire from Heaven,</hi> after <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Example, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of:</hi> and yet not onely ſo, but he was incenſed againſt <hi>Ahab,</hi> by provocations of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Nature, becauſe by his and <hi>Jezebels</hi> command, (1 <hi>King. 19. 14.) The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael <hi>had forſaken the Covenant of his God, thrown down his Altars, and Slain his Prophets with the Sword, and he onely was left, and they ſought his Life alſo.</hi> Nay, <hi>Ahab</hi> had made up the meaſure of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, by depriving <hi>Naboth</hi> of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and his Life, yet when the word of the Lord came to <hi>Elijah</hi> the <hi>Tiſhbite,</hi> he became the Meſſenger of good News to <hi>Ahab, 1 King. 21. 29. Seeſt thou how</hi> Ahab <hi>humbleth himſelf before me? becauſe he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf before me, I will not bring the Evil in his Days. Iſaiah</hi> was undoubtedly a Perſon of a very Sweet and Aimable temper, of a Noble Family, and well practiſed in all the Arts and Language of a flouriſhing Court, as this <hi>A</hi>—well enough obſerves from that flowing vein of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which runs through all his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and his Prophecy is ſo full of Promiſes of good things to the Church, that he is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the Evangelical Prophet;</hi> and yet he was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109220:32"/> ſent by God as a Meſſenger of ill News, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the good <hi>Hezekiah. Iſ. 39. 6. Behold the days come, when all that is in thy houſe, and that which thy Fathers laid up in ſtore until this day, ſhall be carry'd to Babylon, nothing ſhall be left, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And if any man read ch. 53. of his Prophecy, he will find ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note> of a ſuffering Meſſiah, as could not have enter'd into the Head of ſuch an accompliſh'd Courtier, without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of divine Inſpiration. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was a man of ſorrow, and yet your Author can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, that none but Revelation of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful things were made to him, for he foretold the Reſtauration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the preciſe time of it, which certainly was no very ſorrowful matter. I could heap up innumerable inſtances of the ſame Nature, to ſhew your Authors Foundation he would build upon, <hi>(Viz.</hi> That Propheſie was adapted, to the Natural temper of the Prophet, from whence he would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly inſinuate, it was onely an effect of it) is falſe, and repugnant to the United Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the Holy Scriptures. Beſides, who could inform this Temerarious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Natural Conſtitution of the Bodies of the Ancient Prophets? Who knows not that the humours of the Body, are much alter'd, both for the better and the worſe, by External accidents, whether
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109220:33"/> ſad, or joyful. What wonder then that thoſe Prophets who liv'd in the Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Flouriſhing State of the Church, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did for ſome time, and to whom joyful things were for the moſt part revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhould be of a joyful Spirit, and the contrary be recorded of theſe, who were ſent upon ſad and mournful Meſſages? Which is moſt likely, that the meſſage ſhould be cauſe of the Joy? Or the Joy be the cauſe of the meſſage?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> To me, the Scales ſeem to hang even.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>S.</hi> You may ſay what you pleaſe, but ſtill you ſhall never make me believe, but that if God ſpake to Man, he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpeak in the ſame Style, and that Style would be the moſt elegant and florid of any other.

               <p>
                  <hi>L. Difference of Stile</hi> is no Argument of <hi>difference in things,</hi> nor is <hi>the Elegance,</hi> or <hi>Rudeneſs of a Language,</hi> eſſential to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Truth. The Hiſtory of <hi>Saluſt</hi> is as true as that of <hi>Livy;</hi> for he wrote of things done in his own time; whereas <hi>Livy</hi> is full of <hi>fabulous Relations;</hi> and yet I never <note place="margin">p. 20.</note> heard any <hi>Critick</hi> affirm, <hi>That his Stile is as compleat and elegant.</hi> It is enough for us to believe, <hi>that God revealed his Will to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and other inſpired Authors, but left the Narration to the natural Abilities of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> whoſe Stile might vary, but not <hi>their conceptions of the will of God.</hi>

                  <hi>L.</hi> Not in the leaſt: All that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays, is, <hi>That God made himſelf known by thoſe different Repreſentations</hi> to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> does it therefore follow, that they made <hi>theſe Repreſentations to themſelves, out of their own Fancy?</hi> If theſe <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> were really repreſented to them by God, what neceſſity was there, that they ſhould be adapted to <hi>erroneous prejudices of the Prophet?</hi> Such <hi>Revelations</hi> would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of Error, and God would thereby become <hi>the Author, Abetter, and Confirmer of Falſhood in the World;</hi> which none will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, but thoſe who think God to be nothing elſe but the ſetled courſe of dull and ſtupid matter.

                  <hi>S.</hi> Ay, but <hi>the Revelations to the Prophets</hi> did vary not only in <hi>the manner,</hi> but in <hi>the perſpicuity of the Revelation its ſelf.</hi> Thoſe made to <hi>Zachariah</hi> were ſo obſcure, that without an Explication they could not be underſtood by that very Prophet.

Some Divines indeed, who with your Author pretend to the higheſt adoration of humane reaſon, have aſſerted, that God is ignorant of thoſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contingents, which depend upon the free will of Man, and if this be true, <hi>Moſes,</hi> interpreted by your Author, had as true a Notion of God, as many of the Ancient Philoſophers, or ſome of the Modern <hi>Arminians, Socinians,</hi> and Preiſts themſelves, tho it is clear by the Holy Scriptures, that God by his Prophets has foretold thoſe Actions, which depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the free will of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> And is this all you have to ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> No, I will add, that tho God had told <hi>Moſes,</hi> ver. 18. of the 3d Chapter, <hi>That the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>would hearken to his Voice,</hi> Yet at the ſame time, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him, ver. 20. <hi>That he would ſtretch out his Arm, and Smite</hi> Egypt <hi>with all his Wonders.</hi> The Words therefore of <hi>Moſes, Behold they will not believe me, nor hearken to my Voice, imply no contradiction to thoſe words of God himſelf,</hi> v. 18. Chap. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they relate to a different time. It was true, what God told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would hearken to his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109220:40"/> Voice, when it was confirm'd by Signs and Wonders, which were wrought in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and it was true, what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to God, that they would not believe him, nor hearken to his Voice, before thoſe Signs and Wonders were wrought before them. It does not appear from hence, that <hi>Moſes</hi> doubted of the <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> but only longed for that aſſiſtance of his Power, by which God had told him, <hi>he would free the Iſraelites from the ſlavery of Bondage and Error.</hi> Beſides, <hi>(Ex.</hi> 4. 8.) God was revealed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing, that tho the <hi>Iſraelites might at firſt deſpiſe, yet at laſt they would hearken to the voice of Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> All this ſeems to me to be nothing but Evaſion <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had wrong Notions of the Nature of God. He look'd upon him as a Being, that always was, is, and ever ſhall be, and for that reaſon call'd him <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but he taught nothing of his Nature, but that he was Merciful, Living, and very Jealous of Tranferring his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">p. 24.</note> to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> conceived no right notion of a God, Pray let us know your Authors Opinion upon that Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> My Author gives no Definitions, but it is plain from the 26th page, that he looks upon <hi>Moſes</hi> Conceptions of Love, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109220:40"/> Mercy, and Jealouſy, (which are humane paſſions) when aſcribed to God, to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry erroneous, mean, and vulgar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> They cannot be conceived errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unleſs you can prove, that <hi>Moſes</hi> thereby aſcribes ſomething to God, that is imperfect, or vicious in its own Nature, which I preſume you will never be able to do. Love, as it is a humane paſſion, may be vicious when placed upon a wrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as when we love thoſe things which are forbidden, or when it is too remiſs, or too vehement, in reſpect of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects upon which it is placed: But as it is a Principle of doing Good, and Fruitful of Beneficial Emanations to Men and Angels, it is the Perfection and Glory of the Divine Nature, in ſo much that the Apoſtle is not affraid to ſay, that God is Love it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But what think you of Pity, Mercy, Jealouſy, are thoſe paſſions worthily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Yes, very worthily, provided you remove from thence thoſe imperfections, which unavoidably ariſe from the Nature of a humane Soul, and the contexture of a humane body. All our Affections are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with ſome violent perturbation of the body, which cannot be in God, who is an incorporeal Being. Wherefore
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109220:41"/> tho Pity, Jealouſy and Anger be attributed to God, for want of proper and intelligible Names to expreſs ſomething that is like them in the Divine Nature; yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo ſtupid, as to think that God felt the ſame perturbations that Men are ſenſible of in their afflictions. The <hi>Scripture</hi> repreſents God as reſolved to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh unrepenting ſinners; and this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it calls <hi>his Anger;</hi> and it ſhews us, that God is ready to ſuccour the afflicted, and to extend his Pardon to ſome, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſtrict Juſtice are unworthy of it; and his Propenſity to thoſe voluntary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <hi>Moſes</hi> calls by the Name of <hi>Mercy:</hi> and his Eternal Decree, <hi>That his Honour ſhould not be given to his Creatures,</hi> by an eaſy Metaphor is ſtiled <hi>Jealouſy.</hi> But all this includes no Erroneous Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, it onely expreſſes theſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which are known by the light of Nature, in ſuch words as are moſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to all the different Degrees of Men in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You may fancy what Figures you pleaſe, but can you ſhew any good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be underſtood to ſpeak in a Figurative ſenſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Becauſe in this Life we all ſee God, darkly, as through a glaſs, and therefore cannot in all things ſpeak properly of him
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109220:41"/> as he is, but muſt be compelled by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to transfer ſome words from thoſe things we more perfectly underſtand, to ſignfie thoſe Perfections in God, which are leſs perfectly underſtood by us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I wonder you will deny, That the <hi>Revelation</hi> was adapted to the Capacity of the Prophet, when ſo many Inſtances of it are brought by this <hi>Author,</hi> extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from your very Bibles. <hi>Moſes</hi> thought God was in a peculiar manner, Governour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but that the Government of other Countries was left to inferiour <hi>Deities,</hi> who were called, the Gods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations. <hi>See for this, Exod.</hi> 15. 11. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 19. He alſo abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreamed, That God, who is every where, was confined to live in Heaven. <hi>For this, ſee Deut. 33. 27. Jonas</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed himſelf able to fly from the very preſence of God. <hi>Solomon</hi> diſpis'd all the Laws preſcrib'd to a King, tho he was eſteemed the wiſeſt of all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Doctrin of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is directly oppoſite to the Doctrin taught by <hi>Moſes;</hi> as you will find, if you compare his 18 <hi>Chap.</hi> with the <hi>7th. Ver.</hi> of the 31 of <hi>Exod.</hi> or the <hi>18th.</hi> of the <hi>22d.</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> believed, that God never repented of his Decree, <hi>See 15. Sam. ver. 29. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> taught, that God, upon condition
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109220:42"/> of Repentance, did reverſe his Decree of Judgment againſt notorious Sinners. It appears from <hi>Gen. 4. v.</hi> 7. That Man has power to reſiſt Temptation; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, That Man has no Government over his own Thoughts, or Actions, but by the ſingular Calling and Grace of God. <hi>See the</hi> 9th. <hi>to the</hi> Romans. And when he aſcribes Juſtice to God, he Corrects himſelf, by ſaying, <hi>He ſpoke after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men.</hi> From whence it is as clear to me as the Sun, that what you call <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> or <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> never made any man wiſer than he was before, but either left him, or confirm'd him, in thoſe very Prejudices of Opinion, in which at firſt it found him: Unleſs in matters of <hi>Morality,</hi> for therein the Prophets were guided by known, and undeniable <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> You muſter up the whole ſtrength of your <hi>Author's</hi> Forces, which conſiſts more in number, than in true Worth and Dignity. We do not deny that God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends in the manifeſtations of his Will, to accommodate himſelf to the weak ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of his Creature Man, but that does no ways incline us to believe, that he ever reveals to Man any thing that is falſe, or that he confirms him in his preconceived Errors, or that whenſoever he is pleaſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109220:42"/> to reveal himſelf in a Supernatural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he cannot, or does not do it with the ſame degree of Perſpicuity, as one man can tell his Thoughts to another. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, has declared more to one Prophet than to another, but ſince he never ſpeaks any thing but truth to any, this is ſo ſar from being an Argument againſt reading any of the Prophets, (for ſo I call all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Authors) that it is a ſtrong induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to peruſe them all, that ſo what we miſs in one, we may readily find in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If Revelation diſcovered nothing new to Mankind, nor confirm'd truths of an eternal verity, it would be altogether needleſs, and if it by being adapted to Men's erroneous Prejudices, confirm them in the ſame, it would be pernicious, and God himſelf would be the Author, Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Divulger of Falſhood in the world, which I would have all young Men ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider, who are addicted to theſe <hi>Deiſtical Notions. Epicurus,</hi> who removed the <hi>Deity</hi> from all thoughts of humane Affairs, pays more honour to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> than thoſe who with your Author, ſuppoſe him to meddle therein, only to confound <hi>natural Light,</hi> and to contradict himſelf, and to ſend his Servants to plant, and propagate Falſhood in the World.</p>

                  <hi>S.</hi> You ſeem now to be very hot, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can you diſprove the <hi>Author,</hi> whom you raſhly Condemn, becauſe he ſpeaks truth more freely than is conſiſtent with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or Humour of the <hi>Clergy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I deſire to be believed no farther than as you find what I ſay is agreeable to the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> by which it will appear, that God has Revealed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <hi>Inſpir'd Authors,</hi> that any man can condemn of Error. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he has declared to them ſuch truths, as were directly repugnant to their Precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, Erroneous Opinions. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will ſhew you, that the places of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> uſed by your <hi>A</hi>—, are no ways Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his preſent deſign, and purpoſe. If your <hi>Author</hi> would Argue fairly againſt the Authority of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> he ſhould have produced ſuch places in them, which he could eaſily and plainly convince of Error in matters that belong to the Happineſs of Mankind. But how much he fails in this, will appear by a Diſcuſſion of theſe Inſtances, which are alledged by him. <hi>Moſes</hi> taught the <hi>Jews,</hi> that that very God, who made the Heaven and the Earth, was their God, who was revealed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and who then by <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> had brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which plainly ſhews
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109220:43"/> that he had right Conceptions of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> as the firſt, and only cauſe of all things. But at the ſame time he knew, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> worſhipped other created, inviſible Powers, which they called Gods, tho unlike unto the true God, in all the <hi>Glorious Attributes</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> and this is all that can be gathered from the <hi>11th. ver.</hi> of the <hi>15th. Chap.</hi> of <hi>Exodus, Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongſt the Gods? Moſes</hi> does not here aſſert, that there are more Gods than one, but only intimates, that there were more Beings than one, which were (tho falſely and equivocally) called Gods by the deluded <hi>Pagans.</hi> But why do we wonder, that inviſible Powers in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the common Dialect at that time in the World, are ſtiled Gods, when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates themſelves, by no improper Figure are dignified with the ſame honourable Appellation, <hi>Pſ. 6th.</hi> and <hi>7th. I have ſaid you are Gods, and all of you the Children of the moſt High, but ye ſhall dye like men, and fall like one of the Princes.</hi> Will any be ſo abſurd to conclude from hence, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> thought, that there was little or no difference between God and Man? Nor does it at all appear from the <hi>19th. ver.</hi> of the <hi>32d. Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Chron.</hi> That the <hi>Jews</hi> thought, that God left other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109220:44"/> to the Government of other Gods, ſubſtituted by him; the words are theſe, <hi>And they ſpake againſt the God of Jeruſalem, as againſt the Gods of the People of the Earth, which were the work of the hands of men.</hi> It was not the Beſieged <hi>Jews,</hi> but the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pagans,</hi> who called thoſe inferior Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by the name of Gods, which were worſhipped by the deluded <hi>Pagans;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged them only as the work of the hands of men. In the 17 <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> gives only an Hiſtorical Account of the Sentiments of thoſe <hi>Pagans,</hi> who were tranſlated into the Regions of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from remoter Nations; they indeed had the ſame Apprehenſions of the God of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as others had of their Topical Deitys, who were confined to the Government of certain Places, Perſons, Arts, or Sciences, according to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ancients, and therefore mingled ſome Ceremonies of the true, with all the Superſtitions of a falſe Religion. But the <hi>Author</hi> of this Hiſtory, is ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, that he utterly condemns, as well their Notions, as their Practices. In the <hi>23d. ver.—They fear not the Lord, neither do they after his Statutes, or after their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, or after the Law and Commandment, which the Lord commanded the Children of Jacob, whom he named Iſrael.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If <hi>Moſes</hi> had taught, that God was ſo confined to Heaven, as to be excluded from the Earth, or from any part of the Univerſe or from the Knowledge and Government of Humane Affairs, it might have given this <hi>A</hi>—ſome very ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence to cavil; but all that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, in the <hi>26th. ver.</hi> of the <hi>33d.</hi> of <hi>Deut.</hi> is,—<hi>viz. There is none like unto the God of Jeſurun, who rideth on the Heavens in thy help, and in his excellency on the Sky.</hi>—God is every where, but his goodneſs, and power ſtreams forth more upon one place of the Univerſe, than another, for even as the Apoſtle obſerves in inanimate Beings, <hi>There is one Glory of the Sun, and another Glory of the Moon, another of the Stars, for one Star differeth from another Star in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> So much more may we apprehend that God beſtows a greater Degree of his Glory upon thoſe places that are receptacles of the bleſſed Saints and Angels, than upon thoſe which are deſigned to the uſe of ſinful men.

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I cannot deny, but that ſeeing in Scripture, ſignifies no more than knowing, or perceiving, and therefore I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to underſtand this place, as ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only of a clear and diſtinct percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I will not ſtand to confute ſome other ridiculous queſtions of your Author, <hi>Viz.</hi> Where he ſays, <hi>That God threatned</hi> (Exod. 33. 2, 3.) <hi>to ſend his Angel onely to drive off the Hittites,</hi> &amp;c. In complyance to <hi>Moſes</hi> Erroneous Opinion, that other Nations were Governed by other Deities: When himſelf before had owned, that <hi>Moſes</hi> taught, that God whom the <hi>Jews</hi> Worſhipped, was the ſame that was from all Eternity, and made both the Heaven and the Earth: And therefore it could not be an Error in <hi>Moſes,</hi> to think, that God made uſe of Angels in Governing the World, when at the ſame time, he taught, that no other Being was to be Worſhipped, but the Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi> His Obſervation, that <hi>Moſes</hi> aſcended the Mount to ſpeak with God, becauſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving God to dwell in Heaven, he could not ſo well imagine him (as he terms it) in any other place, is ridiculous to the higheſt Degree of Extravagance. What is more unphiloſophical, than to confine
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109220:47"/> imagination to a Mounr, which runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the very bounds of the Univerſe, into imaginary Spaces, as far as it can have any Notion of poſſible exiſtence. As if a Man could never Pray to God whom he believes to be in Heaven, unleſs he raiſed his imagination, by aſcending into the upper Room of his Houſe, or clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd up all the Stairs of the Monument. Nor is he much more ſucceſsful in his other inſtances, upon which he endeavours to lay his rotten and deceitful Foundation. He tells us, <hi>That</hi> Jonas <hi>thought he could fly from the preſence of God, and go into Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſubjected to other Powers, which were created by the ſupream God:</hi> But if this <note place="margin">Jonas 1.</note> was ſo, <hi>Jonas</hi> muſt have very odd Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of thoſe Beings, who were ſubſtituted by God to govern other Nations; he muſt think that they were blind, and ſocould not ſee him come into their Territories, (and yet Angels are ſtiled Watchmen in the Holy Scriptures) or that they were negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and would give no Account of him, to their ſupreme Lord and Maſter, and that reflects much upon Him, who made, or employ'd them, or as Traytors to their Lord, who would willingly conceal a Rebel, which is altogether as abſurd, as any of the preceeding ſuppoſitions. But Pray, why does flying from the preſence
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109220:48"/> of God, neceſſarily imply a deſign to avoid his knowledge, as confined to the Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> Is not <hi>Cain (Gen.</hi> 4. 16.) ſaid to have <hi>gone out from the preſence of the Lord, and dwelt in the band of Nob,</hi> before ever God had given the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> From whence it is to me evident, <hi>that to go from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> ſignifies no more than removing from that place, where the Revelation of the preſence of God is made, to ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter Region. And <hi>Jonas</hi> fled to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh,</hi> not thinking to avoid the ſight of God, but rather fearing Man, more than God; he would not by proclaiming De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> draw upon himſelf the rage and tumult of a Popular Fury. <hi>Solomon</hi> acted contrary to the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to a King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by multiplying Horſes, and Wives, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, but it does not follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God was revealed to him, as approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in one place, which he condemned in another: For Tranſgreſſion of a Law, does not argue Error in Judgment, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength of Appetite in moſt Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, few of which there are but can ſay,
<q>
                     <l>—Video meliora, proboque,</l>
                     <l>Deteriora ſequor.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:109220:48"/> The ſame <hi>Solomon,</hi> perſwaded by his Wives in his latter Days, went to the Temples of ſtrange Gods, (I preſume ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in compliance to their deſires, than to any inclination of his own.) Will your <hi>A</hi>—hence conclude, according to his way of Arguing, that <hi>Solomon</hi> was taught by Inſpiration, the Adoration of a plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Deitys,</hi> when it is as contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as it is to Reaſon it ſelf. As for his imagination, that the <hi>18th. Chap.</hi> of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> is repugnant to the <hi>7th. ver.</hi> of the <hi>34th.</hi> of <hi>Exod.</hi> and to the <hi>18th. ver.</hi> of the <hi>32d.</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> it is not much more hard to be confuted than any of the other. God is declared in the <hi>7th.</hi> of the <hi>34th. As viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unto the third and fourth Generation.</hi> And this is a truth, which all Men muſt obſerve, whether they will or no, it being interwoven into that conſtant order of things, which God has ſettled in the World. If God takes away an Eſtate from a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father, the Son, tho pious, becomes the poorer for it, and the innocent Babe often expires by a Diſeaſe, that is gotten by the vicious Intemperance of a guilty Parent. For God, as Soveraign of the World, may by vertue of his indiſputable Prerogative, inflict whatever temporal Evils he pleaſes, upon the moſt innocent Perſon, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109220:49"/> either by his Fathers Sins, or any other means whatſoever, becauſe he can recompence his light ſufferings here with an eternal weight of Glory hereafter. Nor does <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deny this truth, in the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but only affirms, <hi>That the Son ſhall not be puniſhed eternally for the ſin of his Father:</hi> For that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Puniſhments, which are always afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to Merit, ſeems to me evident from the <hi>26th. ver. When the Righteous Man turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, and dieth in them; for the Iniquity that he hath done, ſhall he dye.</hi> Where a diſtinction is manifeſtly made between Dying in Iniquity, which is the caſe of every Sinner, who dyes without Repentance; and dying for Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which muſt note futute Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World to come, which are called in Scriptures <hi>a ſecond Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Ezekiel</hi> ſeems to me rather in this <hi>Chap.</hi> to ſpeak of God's diſtribution of <hi>Temporal Puniſhments.</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> had taken up the Proverb, <hi>The Fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, and the Childrens teeth are ſet on edge.</hi> Becauſe the Fathers had comitted many grand Tranſgreſſions, and the Children were led into Captivity for them.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:109220:49"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> And no doubt, but the Children alſo had filled up the meaſure of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Iniquity; but admitting even this, which yet ought not to be admitted, there is nothing like a contradiction in theſe two places, when the Son does ſuffer for the Father, if he himſelf is innocent, it is not to him a Puniſhment, nor always a misfortune, and God does not viſit his Trangreſſions upon him, becauſe nothing but wilful Sin is the Object of the <hi>Divine Anger.</hi> For external Evils, they may be turned to our Spiritual advantage, and therefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi> truly affirms, <hi>That the Son ſhall not dye (i. e.</hi> be puniſhed in anger with an utter exciſion) <hi>for the ſin of the Father.</hi> And yet the Son, by the vice and folly of the Father, may fall into very great poverty and afflictions, and by aiding, aſſiſting, and conſenting to his Fathers Crimes, may make himſelf partaker of the guilt, and then is as obvious to Experience, as to Reaſon, that <hi>God does viſit the Iniquity of the Fathers, upon the Children, to the third and fourth Generation.</hi> His other inſtance of <hi>Samuel's</hi> telling <hi>Saul, (1 Sam. 15. 29.) The ſtrength of Iſrael will not lye, nor repent; for he is not a Man, that he ſhould repent;</hi> is no contradiction to what <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſays, 18. 7. <hi>At what Inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109220:50"/> a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil, which I thought to do unto them.</hi> Repentance in God can ſignifie no more than his not inflicting thoſe puniſhments, which he has threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Prophets: But it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, becauſe God would not releaſe the puniſhment of <hi>Saul,</hi> (which is all that can be gathered from the words of <hi>Samuel,)</hi> that therefore God would not avert his threatned puniſhment from any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinner: <hi>For God is not a Man,</hi> (as the Text ſays,) <hi>that he ſhould mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake feigned, for a real repentance.</hi> There are ſome appearances of contradiction in the moſt elaborate Authors, that ever yet wrote in this World, and the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, are as hard put to it to reconcile ſome places that look like contradiction, as any of thoſe who have wrote upon the <hi>Text</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Whatever you may ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Revelation was always adapted to the capacity of thoſe to whom it was made; which makes me think there was nothing Supernatural in that which is ſo called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I will then deſire you to tell me, what you think of the Revelation made to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109220:50"/> 
                  <hi>Noah,</hi> that the World ſhould be drown'd with water. What natural capacity was there in <hi>Noah</hi> to conceive a thing ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, as ſuch a Deluge, when the greateſt Wits in theſe days, who believe it was done, are ſo much puzled to find out the manner of its doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Perhaps being well skilled in <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> he might from the Stars be inform'd of ſome ſtrange alteration in the Weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> And perhaps he might not, nay, it is certain he could not, nor are there any natural means to be conceived, whereby he could be informed of that impending danger; and unleſs you can conceive that <hi>Noah</hi> was ſo ſtark mad as to build an Ark, and take all manner of Beaſts and Fouls into it, out of a fantaſtical Fear, that he ſhould be drowned upon the dry-land; you muſt confeſs, he did it by virtue of a Supernatural Revelation,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Have you any other inſtance of the like nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Yes, more than I ſhall at preſent take pains to enumerate; but however, I will gratifie your curioſity with <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> which will abundantly ſhew the falſity of your <hi>A—s</hi> ſo much boaſted Propoſition. We read in the <hi>18th. Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> that <hi>Sarah</hi> was informed by the Angels, <hi>(10th. ver.) That ſhe ſhould have a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109220:51"/> Son.</hi> But who, except <hi>Spinoſa</hi> will ſay, that this Prediction was accomodated to the capacity of <hi>Sarah,</hi> (or her Lord <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us in the 11<hi>th.</hi> and 12<hi>th. ver. That Abraham and Sarah were old, and well ſtricken in age, and it ceaſed to be with Sarah after the manner of Women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herſelf, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, After I am waxed old, ſhall I have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, my Lord being old alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> A Woman might eaſily imagin what ſhe earneſtly deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If you except againſt a Woman, let us conſider the Revelation made unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> which you will find to be directly contrary to the Apprehenſions, and above the Natural Conceptions of that mighty Prophet. I would feign learn how it was at all agreeable to the natural Conception of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the lifting up his Rod ſhould be able to work all thoſe Signs, and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which it did in the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Tho it was not a Conception agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reaſon, yet it might be to his Fancy, and we all know the ſtrength of Fancy in producing wonders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Imagination, without doubt, has very great force upon the imagining Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that it ſhould be able to have force upon Objects placed without him, ſo as to work any viſible effect upon them,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109220:51"/> is to me, till I am better inform'd, a very abſurd ſuppoſition. I know ſome of the Ancients have been poſſeſſed with an Opinion, that the very Eyes of an Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, do dart a Kind of Poyſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who are in a Great Station. And the <hi>Poets</hi> preſum'd they had the ſame, or like effect upon other Animals.</p>
               <q>Neſcio quis Teneros oculus mihi faſcinat agnos.</q>
               <p>And my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſays ſomething to ſolve this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> by the Effluviums of the Animal Spirits: And if the matter of it were true, which I do very much queſtion, his Lordſhips ſolution of it, would be the beſt that could be given. But ſuppoſing it true yet ſuch weak Effluvia's as are engendered by the ſtrength of imagination, whatever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they can make on the tender parts of humane Bodies, yet you cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Madneſs ſuppoſe them able to turn <hi>Aarons Rod</hi> into a Serpent, (or to make it more like a Living Creature) or turn a whole River into Blood, to divide the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> ſlay all the firſt Born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and do works of the like ſtupendious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <hi>L.</hi> All you can infer from thence is only this, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were aſſiſted by ſome inviſible Powers, which is more than Men of your Principles are willing to grant, who deny their exiſtence, or at leaſt their intermedling with humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But ſuppoſe, ſuch things done (as you Divines call it) by inviſible Powers, how ſhall a Man know whether thoſe Powers are Good, or Evil.</p>

The <hi>Pagan</hi> Prieſts made great pretences to Propheſie and Miracles, but it was to confirm a ſuperſtition, contrary to Natural Light, and therefore thoſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Signs and Wonders, are juſtly aſcribed to the Operation of Lying and Deceitful Spirits. For theſe are known Maxims, that Good cannot proceed from Evil, and that a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand, and we may as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that light can be the Fruitful Mother of Darkneſs, as that <hi>Satan</hi> can be the Author, Abetter, or Confirmer, of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109220:52"/> Precepts of the Decalogue, or the moſt Holy Rules of Practice deliver'd by our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> We don't ſay, that Evil Spirits do never Encourage a ſeeming Sanctity, that is groſs Wickedneſs in a Religious dreſs, but that they can't be Abetters, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgers, of that real and genuine Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is preſcribed by the <hi>Moſaick</hi> and Chriſtian Religion, and of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of which we have as clear Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we have of the Truth of any Mathematical Propoſition.

               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> What think you of the Doctrine of the Incarnation of the Son of God; and of the Holy Trinity, which are founded upon Divine Revelation? Theſe could not be adapted to the Capacity, or Opinions of any one inſpired Author, ſince they are above the conception of all Mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I fear you miſtake this Author. His meaning is not, that nothing is taught in Scripture, which exceeds humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for (as he ſhews, <hi>p.</hi> 28.) The Prophets were ignorant of ſpeculative things, and were of contrary Opinions amongſt themſelves, and therefore they might give Vent to ſome odd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are altogether irreconcilable to the reaſonable conceptions of other Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I have already examined all thoſe places of Scripture, upon which he would ground this wild aſſertion, and I hope, have plainly ſhewed, that no ſuch thing can be deduced from them. But to come cloſer to the purpoſe. Your Author muſt Acknowledge, either that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (as he calls all Divinely inſpired
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109220:53"/> Authors) were aſſiſted and taught by God, or that they were guided by their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fancy, Reaſon, and Judgment. If Prophecy does come from God, and if it be according to his own Definition, in the very firſt Words of his Book, the certain Knowledge of ſome things reveal'd to Men by God, he cannot overthrow the certainty of it, in Speculations as well as Practicks, untill he can deſtroy the very <hi>Idea,</hi> which all rational Men do entertain of God. He muſt ſuppoſe him either to be nothing elſe, but the ſettled courſe and order of Nature, and then he, and his Diſciples muſt quit the Name of <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and ſet up in the open Defence of Atheiſm: Or, he muſt bring upon the Stage an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking, ignorant, or deceitful Deity, that told his Servants a parcel of Idle, Contradictory, and Lying Stories, to amuſe the world with a Noiſe of Divine Truths, whereas they were in reality nothing elſe, but the Erroneous concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fanciful Men. But if on the other hand, he Acknowledge nothing at all of Divinity, in thoſe whom we receive as inſpired Authors, he muſt then ſhew his Reader, how the Propheſies and Miracles of thoſe Men, are reconcilable with the ordinary Courſe and Power of Nature.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> He does ſhew you, in his 4th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there neither is, nor can be any ſuch thing as a Miracle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> We will diſcourſe that point more narrowly ſome other time, but at preſent, I will onely urge one inſtance more, that utterly overthrows your Authors ſandy Foundation. We read, in the 2d Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that when the Apoſtles were all with one accord in one place, there appeared unto them <hi>Cloven Tongues,</hi> and ſate upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. Now I would feign learn from your Author, who ſome ſay was a School Maſter, and therefore ought to be well verſed in the <hi>Didacticks,</hi> whether there be any way in Nature, to teach any one Man, much leſs a Number of Men, the Words, and Idioms of many Foreign and unknown Languages, in a moment, or inſtant of time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I muſt confeſs, I cannot well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how ſuch a thing could be done, without the aſſiſtance of ſome inviſible Power; but ſtill this only proves an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed knowledge of words, but not of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If you grant an infuſed knowledge of words, it is the greateſt Folly in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109220:54"/> World to deny the poſſibility of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed knowledge of things. For it is much more eaſy to conceive, that God can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his will to ſome choſen Perſons, and leave the manner of expreſſing it to their natural and acquired Abilities; than that he ſhould infuſe, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of time, the knowledge of ſeveral Languages into the minds of unlearned Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I for my part, am reſolved never to be a Bigot in ſpeculative Matters, and ſince he ſpeaks ſo much for Morality in all parts of his Book, I cannot chooſe but have a good Opinion of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Morality, and Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, ſerve many times for canting terms, to be ſpecious covers to Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Non-ſenſe. He grants, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had clear Perceptions of Morality, for ſo may all Mankind beſides, but that we are not bound to believe them in any thing that is ſpeculative; that is, we may Lawfully reject all the <hi>Credenda</hi> of the <hi>Moſaick,</hi> or the Chriſtian Religion. As for Example, according to his way of arguing, when the Scripture tells, <hi>You muſt Love the Lord your God, with all your Heart, with all your Soul,</hi> It onely teaches you, that you ſhould be Pious; but you are not bound to believe from thence,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109220:55"/> that there is a God, or that he Governs the World, or that he alone is to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, for theſe, according to his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, are ſpeculative Opinions, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which the Prophets had contrary and repugnant Notions: And thus your Author would plant abundance of Piety, but not one grain of the Knowledge of God in the World. After the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when the Apoſtle ſays, 2 <hi>Theſ. 1. 7. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be reveal'd from Heaven, with his mighty Angels,</hi> v. 8. <hi>in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> v. 9. <hi>Who ſhall be puniſhed with Everlaſting Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi> We are to Learn, that we are to obey the Goſpel in being Juſt and Charitable, but we muſt not thence, infer, that thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and uncharitable, <hi>Shall certainly be Puniſhed with Flaming Fire, or with an Everlaſting Destruction from the Face of the Lord;</hi> And I will now leave it to your Judgment what Friend he can be to Piety, Juſtice, or Charity, who diveſts them of the certainty of a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and leaves them no other Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, than what ariſes from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the paſſions in this Life,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109220:55"/> which tho it be a conſiderable part, yet it cannot be the whole of humane Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Or, whether he is not an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of Impiety, Injuſtice, and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all manner of known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Vices, who takes away from wicked Men, the Terror of being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Devil and his Angels. For tho our Saviour ſays, <hi>Mat. 12. 16. If Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt himſelf, his Kingdom cannot stand.</hi> He will have this Argument only adapted to the Opinion of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but no proof that there is a Devil, or any Kingdom of malicious Spirits, and ſo good night to your Author's Morality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> When you read his <hi>4th. Chap.</hi> you will ſee how earneſtly he Pleads for Virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If you will bring me what he ſays, another time, I will gladly admit all that is true, and oppoſe nothing but notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Falſhoods.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> WEll, <hi>Sir,</hi> according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I have read over the <hi>4th. Chap.</hi> of my Author, (paſſing by his <hi>third,</hi> becauſe it chiefly concerns the <hi>Jews,)</hi> wherein, I find him to be a very zealous Advocate of true Virtue and Goodneſs, which I value more than any Speculative Opinion, ſo much contended for by the Sons of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If obedience and ſubmiſſion to God, is the principal Law of Nature, then it is as much our Duty, to believe a Truth when revealed, as it is to obey a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment when it is promulged, and then it follows, that what he calls Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, is neither more nor leſs than a practical, neceſſary Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Your error proceeds from your falſe Apprehenſions of a true notion of a Law. He ſhews you in his <hi>43d. Page,</hi> that the word Law, abſolutely taken, ſignifies that, according to which every individual, or ſome of the ſame ſpecies, do all, or ſome one thing, by a certain and determinate Reaſon; and that it depends either upon
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109220:56"/> the neceſſity of Nature, or the conſent, or authority of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Then farewel at once to all <hi>Divine Laws,</hi> but thoſe which he fancys depend upon the neceſſary motions of matter, or are confined by the Authority of the Civil Magiſtrate, or receive their ſtrength from the mutual conſent of ſome determinate Society of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I hope you will not deny, that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Neceſſity is a Law, when all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſpeak in the ſame Dialect; does not <hi>Cartes</hi> make mention of the Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. Cartes,</hi> and other Philoſophers, have the liberty to Transfer words from their proper Signification, to denote ſuch things as are beſt underſtood by a metaphorical Expreſſion. And hence it is, that thoſe Obſervations, which ingenious Men make of the neceſſary reſt of motion of matter, are called (but figuratively) by the name of Laws; but your <hi>A—</hi> ſhews no <note place="margin">Legis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> ſmall plenty of ignorance, when he would have the word Law, to ſignifie, abſolutely, corporeal neceſſity of Nature, which properly ſpeaking is not capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Nomen Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis per Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlationemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videtur.</note> a Law. Nay, he ſeems to contradict himſelf, for he ſays in the <hi>44th. Page,</hi> that the word Law, ſeems to be applyed to natural things, by Tranſlation, and if
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109220:57"/> by Tranſlation, then not abſolutely, or properly, as in this place he ſo boldly affirmeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But what need this ſtrife about words, if we are agreed upon the thing it ſelf? Why may not my Author claim the ſame liberty of Speech, as is allowed to <hi>Des Cartes, Gaſſendus,</hi> or others of our modern Virtuoſo's?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Becauſe he deſigns thereby to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a fatal neceſſity in the very minds of Men, which renders them uncapable of receiving a Law, properly ſo called, which always ſuppoſes a liberty of choice, and is attended with the Sanctions of Rewards and Puniſhments; for tho in the <hi>44th.</hi> Page he tells us, <hi>That ſome Laws depend upon the free Arbitration of Men,</hi> yet he adds, <hi>That he muſt needs grant, that all things are determined by the univerſal Laws of Nature, both to Operate, and to Exiſt, in a certain, and unavoidably manner;</hi> and indeed if all things that are, are material, and the Soul its ſelf nothing but a particle of rarefied matter, and all matter is bound by the neceſſity of nature, to ſuch and ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Rules; it follows, thoſe Laws of Men which ſeem moſt Arbitrary, are as much ſubject to fatal neceſſity, as any other operation of dull, and unthinking matter. All the difference is, that in the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109220:57"/> deſcending of a Stone, or the aſcending of the Fire, we can ſee and underſtand the Concatenation, and Co-ordination of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cauſes, but this Chain is leſs viſible in the determinations of the Will, to what we call Moral Good or Evil. But ſtill there is a Chain, that binds a Man as ſtrongly, as if its invincibility was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the Eyes of all Men: and if ſo, then he that kills his Father, or Mother, acts by the ſame neceſſary Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he that Honours and Obeys them. And this is the beſt, and trueſt account, that I can give of your <hi>Author's</hi> Scheme of Morality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You muſt needs miſtake him, for he has theſe words,</p>
               <q>Dico tamen has leges, ex placito Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum pendere.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> That is, becauſe your <hi>A</hi>—would Monopolize the liberty of contradicting his own Aſſertions, but obſerve his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he does not ſay abſolutely, that theſe, or any Laws do depend upon the free will of Man, but that they may be ſaid to do ſo. Firſt, <hi>Becauſe Man being a part of Nature, whatſoever is done by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Humane Nature, tho it be done by the general, and irreſiſtable force of Nature,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109220:58"/> yet becauſe they proceed immediately from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power, therefore the Sanctions of thoſe Laws may be ſaid to proceed from the will of Man.</hi> But what is this to the purpoſe? If there be a general force of Nature, which determines all things even the very Soul and Will of Man, to make Laws whether it will or no, then the making theſe Laws, or the paying Obedience to them, are no free, but neceſſary Acts, and Men are morally good or evil, not by free choice, but by a neceſſary compulſion: And this he plainly acknowledges in his ſecond reaſon, and onely adds, that the Univerſal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fate, and concatenation of cauſes, cannot ſerve us, to form right conceptions of Law, and that therefore tho all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are predetermin'd by fate, yet it is better to talk of them as Free and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Let us not quarrel about words, but come to the Definition of the thing, he tells you, that a Law is a Manner of Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which a Man preſcribes to himſelf, or to others, for ſome End, beſt known to himſelf. How do you like this Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition? <note place="margin">p. 44.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I ſhould rather have approved of it, if he had defin'd it a Manner of Living, preſcribed by a Superior to an Inferior, and always attended with the Sanction of Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:109220:58"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Every Man Loves the Product of his own Brains; but Pray, why is your Definition to be preferr'd before my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> For ſeveral Reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does not exclude God from the Legiſlative Power, which is moſt ſlily done in your Author's Definition. A Law is a Rule, or Manner of Living, or Acting, that is ſuppoſed to proceed from ſome Rational, Intelligent, or thinking Being. And if your Author believes that any ſuch Being, is really exiſtant, why muſt he be excluded from the Legiſlative Power, and his Creature, Man, onely Intitled to it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Does not my Author expreſsly ſay, <hi>(p.</hi> 45.) That the Law is to be Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into Divine and Humane?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Yes: But he tells you, that by a humane Law, he means ſuch a manner of Living, as is conducive to preſerve our lives, or the common wealth, and by a Divine Law he intends no more than a Law made, that has reſpect to the true Knowledge and Love of God. So that a Law made by God, to preſerve a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or the Life of Man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Notion, is a humane Law, and a Law made by Man, which is referred to the Love and Knowledge of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109220:59"/> a Divine Law. God is therefore abſolutely excluded by him, from any, ſo much as Vote, or ſhare of the Legiſlative Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Well, what is your next Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I think in the 2d place, that he does not accurately enough define a Law, by a manner of Living preſcribed by a Man to himſelf. For Law implies Superiority in the very eſſential Notion of it. If a Man preſcribes a certain way of Living, or Acting to himſelf, it is at moſt but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which may, upon alteration of circumſtances, be revoked without a Sin. If indeed, he calls God as a Witneſs to ſuch a reſolution, it becomes a Vow, and has in Lawful matters, all the Force and Virtue of a Law; but that force ariſes from the Superiority of the Perſon, <hi>Viz. God himſelf, unto whom that Vow is made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Do not <hi>Senators</hi> make Laws, that bind themſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Yes, and very juſtly too. For the Authority of a Collective Body of Men, is Superior to the Authority of any one Member of it, and he, or they that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt it, in all Democratick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, are to be look'd upon, out of the <hi>Senate,</hi> but as Subjects to that Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Power which is in the collected Body.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:109220:59"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> This at moſt, is but a vain <hi>Logoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;</hi> Pray, what have you more than this, to object againſt this Definition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I ſay, Thirdly, that he very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully leaves out the Sanction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, which are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Cannot a Superior preſcribe a Rule to an Inferior, without adding threats, or promiſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Yes, he may: But then the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obedience ariſes from the Good, that may be gained by that Obedience, or by the Evil, that may be avoided by it. If a Superior, by which I underſtand one that has Power and Right over me, command me to do a thing, it follows, that my diſobedience muſt needs expoſe me to the dire Effects of his Diſpleaſure, and that is a ſufficient Sanction to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Law, without any expreſs threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any one particular puniſhment, the Power of Inflicting, which is ſuppoſed as eſſentially inherent in the Superior Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And the ſame is to be ſaid of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I think my Author ſhews very well, that cunning Lawgivers allure the vulgar to obedience, to wholeſome Laws, by propounding to them a quite different end, from that which is eſſential to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109220:60"/> Law its ſelf. For my part, I am willing to be Virtuous, for the reward, that by the neceſſity of Nature, muſt needs Spring from Virtue its ſelf; but I have no great Opinion of other Allurements, by which you Divines would intice Men to follow your own Direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I eaſily grant you, that there is a pleaſure of mind, ariſing from all Acts of Genuine Virtue, as there is a regret and torment, that attends upon Vice: And that the certain pain, or pleaſure, which Accompanies theſe, with the addition of what probably may be farther expected from God, are the very Sanctions of the Law of Nature. But if there were no pain, or pleaſure, that followed any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either by neceſſity of Nature, or free will of God, I cannot conceive how there could be any ſuch thing as a Law. For to what purpoſe is a Law, when the Tranſgreſſion brings no Inconvenience, nor the performance of any pleaſure, or profit to the Subject?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> How many Laws are daily Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, and yet no Puniſhment inflicted on the offenders? Do they therefore ceaſe to be Laws?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> No. Becauſe tho puniſhment is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually inflicted upon all that <hi>offend,</hi> yet it is threatned to all, and the very danger of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109220:60"/> incurring the penalty, is a ſufficient Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in a penal Law, if all poſſibility of offending God, or Man, or our ſelves, were taken away, it would then loſe the very Nature of Law, and revolt again into its firſt State of Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>erency. To gain therefore Good, and to avoid Evil, is the true Ends of all Laws; and your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor very much miſtakes the point, when he repreſents rewards and puniſhments, as adapted onely to govern the vulgar, who know not the true End of Laws, and have not Learned the great Art of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtuous for Virtues ſake. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, are adapted to work upon the will and affections of all mankind, even the Author himſelf, who would not have ventur'd to write ſuch a Book, if he had liv'd in a Countrey, where he had been ſure to have been pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed as he deſerves for it. He that Loves Virtue, or hates vice, muſt do it either for ſome Good, or Evil, eſſentially inherent, or accidentally annexed to them, and if God by <hi>Moſes</hi> and our Saviour did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, confirm and enlarge theſe Sanctions, or adapt them in ſome caſes to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the vulgar, it does not follow, that obedience to theſe Laws is ſervile, but rather that it is a reaſonable ſervice.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:109220:61"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Is he a juſt Man, that forbears to ſteal for fear of hanging?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> No: but yet he may be a juſt Man, who forbears to ſteal, for fear of running into that Evil, which reaſon ſhews is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically inherent in it, or which God by his Prophets has threatned, as conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential to it. And therefore to diſſwade Men from having any regard to rewards, or puniſhments, is the ſame thing as to diſſwade them from Acting like Men, or chooſing what is beſt, like unto rational Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Notwithſtanding your Pulpit-Cants, my Author gives you a more noble Scheme of Virtue. He ſhews you, that our underſtanding being our beſt part, our chiefeſt happineſs conſiſts in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that moſt excellent faculty. That all certain knowledge we can have, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the knowledge which we have of God, becauſe nothing can exiſt, or be conceived without God, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we may doubt of all things, whilſt we have no clear conception of God: Hence he tells you it follows, that all things which are in Nature, according to the manner of their Exiſtence, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, do involve, or expreſs our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of God, and that therefore by how much the more we know Natural
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109220:61"/> things, ſo much the more we acquire a more perfect conception of God, or may be ſaid to know the very eſſence of God. And he is moſt happy, who loves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Knowledge of God above all things, and is moſt delighted with it. And theſe mediums of this knowledge, as far as conducive to this End, may be called the Laws of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Perfection of the underſtanding, cannot render a Man compleatly happy, unleſs he can prove that there is no other faculty in the mind of Man, but that of underſtanding only. For ſuppoſe, a Man has a good underſtanding, but an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Will and Affections, that Man cannot be ſaid to be compleatly happy. For happineſs being a full Enjoyment of all good things, it muſt be equally extended to all the faculties of the mind, or it ceaſes to be true happineſs. Our Saviour ſpeaks more emphatically to the purpoſe, <hi>Ye know theſe things, happy are ye, if ye do them.</hi> His Reaſon, why all the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty can be had by Man, depends upon his right Knowledge of God, is very falſe and deceitful, <hi>Viz. Becauſe nothing can be, or be conceived without God.</hi> By which obſcure Circumlocution he means no more, in plain terms, than that there is no other God than the Univerſe, and that all
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109220:62"/> things that are in Nature, as he ſays, do involve a conception of God, and that by knowing natural things, we know the very Eſſence of God. For if God himſelf is not matter, an accurate knowledge of matter, cannot give us entrance into a more accurate Knowledge of God. <hi>The</hi>

That is, <hi>Our Knowledge, that ſome viſible things are made, which could not make themſelves, leads Man to an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they were made by the Eternal, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Power of the Godhead.</hi> But this Knowledge ariſes not from an accurate diſcuſſion of all the properties of matter, ſince it may be deduced from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its bare Exiſtence. For the very Creation of Matter, ſhews the Inviſible Power of God, tho his wiſdom is more viſibly ſeen in the various Modification of it. But ſtill it does not follow, that they who beſt know Natural things, do beſt know the very Eſſence of God, unleſs God himſelf be nothing elſe but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Univerſe. Suppoſe, a Man ſhould be a great <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in rendring an Account of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of ſecondary cauſes, and yet
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109220:62"/> ſhould deny the inviſible Power of God, would you ſay, that by how much the more perfectly he knew natural things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo much more perfectly, he knew the very Eſſence of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Will you deny what he ſo zealouſly aſſerts, <hi>That the knowledge and love of God is the happineſs of Man, the very end and ſcope of all humane Actions, and the chiefeſt Good that can be attained by us.</hi> Is it not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaid by him, <hi>That we are to love God as our chiefeſt Good, not for fear of any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor for love of any thing with which we are delighted, but meerly for himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If your Author, who ſo often makes mention of the word <hi>God,</hi> would have told us diſtinctly what he meant by it, this <hi>46th</hi> page would have ſeem'd to have had ſomething like Natural Religion in it. But if you reflect upon the preceeding words, and the whole ſcope of his book, you will find, that God ſignifies no more in him, than the whole Compages of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that he who knows Natural Things, knows the very Eſſence of God; and then to know God, and to love God, tho ſplendid Terms, yet in reality ſignifie no more than to turn <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and ſtudy the Works of Nature, and to love the World, and hug its Enjoyments as your whole happineſs, without troubling your
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109220:63"/> head with the thoughts of the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the fear of Hell, which your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor rejects, as conceptions unworthy of a true Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I, for my part, own an incorporeal Deity, tho I don't believe all the Stories you Parſons tell us of him; and I believe my Author is of the ſame mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I do not find it appear in any part of his Writings But this I obſerve, that by God he underſtands a Being, that cannot ſpeak intelligibly to mankind, but by the fixed courſe of Nature, and that ſuffers us to be abuſed by Jugling Tricks and Impoſtures, that Vaunt themſelves as Divine Revelations, and that cannot work a miracle, unleſs your Author gives him leave, and from whom you are to expect no Good, and to fear no Evil. So that all his morality, is reduced to the Love and Knowledge of God, and that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Univerſe, or an <hi>otioſe,</hi> unactive Being, which is next to nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Some men are reſolved to approve of nothing. Pray, what can you ſay, concerning thoſe conſequences, which he draws from his Notion of the Law of Nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If you tell me what they are, I will give you my impartial opinion of them.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:109220:63"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> He ſays, reaſon is univerſal, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation limited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> That the Law of Nature, rightly underſtood, is Univerſal; will eaſily be granted by thoſe who underſtand what humane Nature is. But your Author cannot infer from hence, that it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Good to mankind than Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, becauſe it is a more general good. For tho a diffuſive Good in reſpect of its diffuſive Nature, is to be preferred before that which is reſtrained and confined, <hi>coeteris paribus,</hi> yet it is not to be ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, or without exception. Virtue is a greater Good than the light of the Sun, even in your Authors Opinion, who calls it the chiefeſt Good of man, and yet more men receive benefit from the Light of the Sun, than from Genuine Virtue, if you will believe the <hi>Greek</hi> Proverb,</p>

                  <hi>S.</hi> Ay, but this is the great advantage of reaſon above Revelation, that it does not require an Hiſtorical belief, which can never work in us the Love of God; for that is onely to be deduced from ſuch common Notions, as carry their own certainty along with them.</p>

                  <hi>L.</hi> The great defects of Hiſtory, are uncertainty, deficiency, ſuperfluity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency; when theſe are abſent, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is very completive of the intellectual faculties of man. For Hiſtory is nothing elſe, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> well obſerves, but a Narration of the various Operations of Individuals circumſcribed to Time and Place, and its chief end is to advance memory, which is as it were the great Store-Houſe, or Magazine of Knowledge. Uncertain Hiſtory is a Narration of ſuch things, as either never were done, or have not been well atteſted, ſo as to leave no room for doubt. And this defect in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſtroys the very end of it, which is to give us a certain account of what has been done already, that ſo we may know how to Act our ſelves for the future. Deficient Hiſtory, is an imperfect collection of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Occurrences, wherein many things are omitted, which are worthy a wiſe Mans obſervation. And tho this deſtroys not the End of Hiſtory, which is certainty of knowledge, yet it Anſwers not the Expectations of a Thirſty Soul. Impertinent, or Superfluous Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, is a Narration of ſuch Actions, or Circumſtances of Action, as for their turpitude, or meaneſs, deſerve not to be recorded. And this is a defect,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109220:64"/> which can no other ways be ſupplied, than by a total abolition of thoſe trifling Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> What is it you would infer from hence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> That Faith grounded upon true and uſeful Hiſtory, may give us a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and due love of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> How can Faith, that reſts upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority, contend for certainty with Reaſon, that proceeds by ſuch common Notions, which are admitted as true by all men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Natural Reaſon does enable men to underſtand, that God ought to be loved, as the firſt cauſe of all thoſe good things, which his Creature Man does enjoy. But then there is a certainty in Senſe, as well as in Reaſon, tho after another manner: And therefore, if the Senſes of ſome Men have been rationally convinced, that God has beſtowed other Benefits upon them, than thoſe that were beſtowed at their Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or conveyed by the inviſible Hand of his Providence: Why ſhould not ſuch a knowledge excite them to all imaginable Love, and Gratitude to their great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor? The certainty of a Benefit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is all that every good Man requires, in order to be Grateful; and whether that certainty is grounded upon abſtracted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109220:65"/> or a true, faithful Narrative of a mattter of Fact, is not much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe—So abſurdly does your <hi>A—</hi> aſſerts, <hi>Nec fides Hiſtoriarum quantumvis certa, Dei cognitionem, &amp; conſequenter, nec eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Dei amorem vobis da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You Divines repreſent God to the Vulgar, as a Law-giver, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you call his Laws; but alas, you miſtake the point. For Eternal Verities are the only Laws of God, who Acts by the neceſſity of his own Nature: For the Affirmations, and Negations of God, do always involve an Eternal verity and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in themſelves. If God had ſaid to <hi>Adam, Thou ſhalt not Eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> it would imply a contradiction to ſay, that he did Eat of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Does not your Author in ſome places ſay, <hi>That to know and to Love God is the Divine Law?</hi>

                  <hi>L.</hi> Then according to his way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all men (even the Author himſelf) do know and Love God, and muſt do ſo whether they will or no, to the End of the World: And then there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Virtue and Vice, for both are done according to God's Will, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Authors ſentiments, for both are the Effects of an Eternal neceſſity, of cauſes linkt together. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>This is the Will of God, even your Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Therefore all men are actually ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, <hi>God bid</hi> Abraham <hi>Sacrifice his Son, therefore he was Sacrificed; is not this a pretty way of arguing, to make ſport for Children and Fools?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Moral Propoſitions in themſelves, are nothing but Eternal Verities, and it was the Prophets only, who were led by fancy, and the Vulgar who are guided by ſenſe, who apprehend them as Laws given by God, <hi>The Law-giver, whom they look upon as a juſt and merciful Prince, ſetting upon a Throne, and diſtributing rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments, to all his Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Your Author muſt either grant, that God is a wiſe and underſtanding Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a free Agent, or nothing elſe but the Maſs of Dull and unthinking matter. If he embrace the latter, he ſhould be Maſter of ſo much courage as to tell us,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109220:66"/> and not to play always in the dark, with his two ambiguous Terms of God and Nature. If he will allow, that God is a wiſe Being, and a free Agent, I cannot conceive any reaſon, why he ſhould deny him to be a Law-giver, ſince Wiſdom, Power, and Authority, are inſeparably interwoven into the very Notion of a God, without any groſs conceptions of his ſetting upon a Throne, like an Earthly Monarch. And if there is an Eternal reaſon, why <hi>God ſhould be Loved, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence Protected,</hi> &amp;c. Which every Man is conſcious to himſelf, that he can do, or let it alone; and beſides, <hi>If God ſhews Man by Divine Revelation, what he would have done, and promiſes Rewards and Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments, why muſt theſe Dictates of God and Nature be denied to be Laws, and I know not what Eternal Verities ſhuffled into their Room?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Becauſe my Author ſhews, that all Moral Propoſitions are ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Your Author ſhews nothing but meer Leger-de-main. <hi>It is an Eternal Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that God is to be Worſhipped, but it is no Eternal Verity that he is ſo.</hi> A Moral Propoſition is a Divine Law, and an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Verity in reſpect to that Goodneſs, which is Eſſential to it; but not for any Active neceſſity that attends the fame.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109220:66"/> For if the Will and Underſtanding be the ſame Thing in God, <hi>Then God Wills all the Treaſons, Marthers, and Adulteries, which he understands have been committed in the World.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Since you deſpiſe my Author's Scheme of Morality, Pray, let us hear one of your own drawing up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I will refer that to Dr. <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s excellent Treatiſe of the Law of Nature, where he proves by reaſon equivalent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if not ſurpaſſing Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the Law of God, and the whole rational univerſe, is the whole of the Law of Nature, and attended with ſufficient Sanctions of Rewards and Puniſhments, that are by God inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly interwoven into the Nature of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You do not hear me ſpeak againſt the Natural Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> But by embracing unſound Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, you utterly deſtroy the whole Force and Efficacy of it. Your Piety termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the adoration of ſuch a Piety, as tamely ſuffers the World to be abuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a belief of Miracles and Propheſie, and Inſpiration, without any rational poſſibility of a redreſs, and Acts by the inflexible neceſſity of his own Nature, ſo that all our Prayers, can make no more an impreſſion upon him, than upon a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109220:67"/> Stone-Wall. Your Juſtice has no Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a future reward, and ſo in private is left at liberty, to Act what is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the preſervation of life and limb. And your Temperance has no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, nor ſo much neither, than what Nature has given to thoſe Beaſts that Periſh. Thus your Deiſm begins with a fair pretence to Moral Philoſophy, but the End thereof is nothing elſe but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Liberty and Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I muſt confeſs, <hi>If there were rewards in Heaven, and Puniſhments in Hell, they would be great Encouragements to Virtue, and Suitable determents from Vice.</hi> But you ground your hopes upon inſpired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and they pretend to prove their Divine Miſſion by Miracles, whereas my Author proves, that there never was, nor can be ſuch a thing as a true Miracle, wrought in the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Then I will Diſcourſe that point with you, at our next Meeting, for I am loth to tire you with too long a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> SIR, you are well met: I remember, at our laſt Conference, you often appealed to Miracles, as the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of reveal'd Religion. But I have ſince that time carefully peruſed the Sixth Chapter of my very Ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, wherein I find ſuch Arguments againſt Miracles, as make me very much doubt, whether there ever was, or can be ſuch a thing as a Miracle, done in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I deſire not to hear your Opinions, but would gladly be a Partaker of your Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> My Author very Judiciouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <note place="margin">p. 67.</note> that it is, and always was the Mob of mankind, that are and were the great Miracle-Hunters, and Miracle-Makers. It is they, who think nothing to be the Work of God, that is done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſual Courſe of Nature, but feign and believe Wonders, on purpoſe, that they may be thought the very Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109220:68"/> of Heaven, <hi>And that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe was made for the ſake of Man, one of the moſt inconſiderable Creatures in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Our belief of Miracles, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that reaſon, which is common unto all Mankind, not only the Unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Vulgar, but alſo the moſt ſublime Philoſophers, who muſt needs Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that if matter was at firſt Created by a Spiritual Being out of nothing, and received from it thoſe Determinations of reſt, or motion, which we call its Laws, it may be again produc'd, or alter'd by the very ſelf ſame Power, which is all that is neceſſary to conſtitute a Miracle. The poſſibility therefore of a Miracle, is as evident to all Learned men, who have not ſaid in their Hearts, <hi>that there is no God,</hi> as any one propoſition in <hi>Enclid,</hi> and is as deducible from the true Idea of a God, as any of the moſt Legitimate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, that can be deduced from clear and undoubted premiſes. Your Author therefore with as much Haughtineſs as Falſehood, pretends to throw the belief of Miracles upon the Vulgar only; as if all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Chriſtian Kings and Emperors; all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſphers, by Miracles converted to the Chriſtian Faith; all the Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, that were, or ever ſhall be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109220:68"/> in the Church of God; were no better than an ignorant and unlearned Mob, in reſpect to himſelf, and two or three up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart Philoſophers, who value themſelves upon the oppoſition they endeavour to make, againſt the moſt common Notions of all mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You begin to be too warm; Pray, let us debate this matter; with more Reaſon and leſs Paſſion. My Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refers you to his Fourth Chapter of the Divine Law, where he has largely prov'd, <hi>That whatſoever God determines, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 68.</note> 
                  <hi>an Eternal neceſſity, becauſe the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of God, is not really diſtinguiſhed from his Will.</hi> And ſince nothing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily done, but by Virtue of a Divine decree, it clearly follows, <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Laws of Nature, are the only Decrees of God.</hi> If therefore any thing ſhould happen in Nature, that is repugnant to her Univerſal Laws, the ſame thing would be repugnant to the Divine Nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Your Authors affected obſcurity in this Paragraph, is a ſign of want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe want of Courage, to ſpeak what he really thinks. He that would deſtroy the poſſibility of Miracles, muſt prove that there is no God, who has the ſame liberty of will, which we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109220:69"/> to be in our ſelves. And then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it would clearly follow, that if there was no God, nor no free Inviſible Agents, there could be no ſuch thing as a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle performed in the World. But Pray, how does your Author prove this Grand Aſſertion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Oh, Sir, very Mathematically. He <note place="margin">See p. 49.</note> does it by the properties of a <hi>Triangle.</hi> For it is the ſame thing to ſay, that God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands that the 3 <hi>Angles</hi> of a <hi>Triangle</hi> are equal to 2 Right ones, as it is to ſay, that he wills it ſhould be ſo. For the truth of that propoſition, depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nature of a <hi>Triangle,</hi> but the very Nature of God, in whom will and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are the ſame things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> That a <hi>Triangle</hi> muſt needs have 3 <hi>Angles,</hi> equal to two Right ones, depends upon that Eternal truth in things, which is antecedent even to the Divine voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Becauſe it implies a contradiction in the very Terms, to deny the ſame; and it is no limitation of the Power, or Will of God, to ſay he cannot will, or do theſe things, which imply a Contradiction in the very Terms. Gods underſtanding, or will, no more alters the eſſential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a <hi>Triangle,</hi> than the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a man, becauſe they flow from the very Idea of it. But is there
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:109220:69"/> the ſame neceſſity, that matter ſhould be always ty'd to the ſame Rules of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as there is, that the 3 <hi>Angles</hi> of a <hi>Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,</hi> ſhould be equal to two Right ones? Does it imply a contradiction in the very Terms, that matter ſhould be created by a Spiritual Being, or receive its Laws of Motion from him, or have thoſe Laws controlled, or ſuſpended by the ſame Power that made them. If Nature be nothing indeed but matter and motion, and God be nothing elſe but Nature, then there can be no Miracles; not becauſe the underſtanding, or Will of God are the ſame, but becauſe, according to this Hypotheſis, there can be no ſuch thing as Will, or Underſtanding in God. Your Author in his Annotations tells us, that by Nature he underſtands not only matter, but <hi>alia infinita;</hi> but Pray, what <hi>alia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finita</hi> are theſe, that are comprehended under the word Nature? If a Spiritual and Intelligent Being, let him ſhew rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why he cannot as well alter the courſe of the World, as he could at firſt Create it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Becauſe it would argue mutability in God, which all ſound Philoſophers do acknowledge to be an Imperfection, that is unworthy of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:109220:70"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> This cannot be owned by thoſe Philoſophers, who believe that the world was not <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> but Created by God. For there is more of Mutability in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Univerſe, than in the additional Creation of ſome parts of it only, which is all that we can underſtand by the word Miracle. I grant, indeed, that the Univerſal Laws of Motion, which God has given to the Univerſe, are ſufficient, to preſerve the World in that Beauty and Order, wherein we now both ſee and enjoy it; and that we may from thence Learn the great Wiſdom of our Heavenly Father, who could ſettle ſuch a courſe and order of things, by Chaining each effect to its moſt immediate cauſe, as might be ſufficient to ſupport the World to all Ages, without the frequent interpoſition of a Miraculous Power, to alter, or to amend, as it were, the work of his Hands. For if this ſettled courſe and order of things, did not give us a right Notion of the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power, and other Glorious Attributes of our great Creator, the Love of God could not be any Branch of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which yet in words, at leaſt is more than once acknowledged by your own Author. Miracles, therefore, as your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor well enough obſerves, are not at all
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109220:70"/> neceſſary to ſuſtain, or preſerve the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, ſince that may be, and is done by the ſettled and ordinary courſe of Nature. But yet there are other reaſons, which render Miracles highly neceſſary to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, at ſome times, and upon ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal occaſions, ſo that without them, we ſhould be the moſt miſerable Creatures of the whole Univerſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I would gladly hear what thoſe reaſons are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> When <hi>Revelation</hi> is neceſſary to ſhew men the way to Happineſs, then Miracles are equally neceſſary to ſhew men, that ſuch Beneficial <hi>Revelations</hi> do come from God. All men deſire Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are conſcious to themſelves, that it is not in their own Power, but in the Gift of God. But they never can come to a certainty, either what Degree of Happineſs God will beſtow, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what conditions, nor what Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be accepted for Sin, without the Benefit of Divine Revelation, and ſuch Revelation cannot be made evident, without the rational Demonſtration of a Miraculous Power. For either God muſt make this Revelation to all mankind, which would diſorder, in a manner, the whole Courſe of Nature, by changing the Natural Faculties of the mind, into
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:109220:71"/> Supernatural Endowments, or he muſt beſtow a Divine Power upon thoſe few, to whom he immediately reveals his Will, whereby they may be known to be ſent by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Will you pretend then, that Gods readineſs to confer Happineſs, and to forgive Sins, are not known by the Light of Nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I grant, that the Great Benignity of the Divine Nature, is eaſily deducible from all the Works of his Hands, by all the Rules of unerring Reaſon: <hi>And if we were Conſcious to our ſelves of no Sin, we might be certain that we ſhould receive no Evil from him.</hi> But ſuppoſing our ſelves innocent (which yet is a very wild ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) we cannot from the good things we enjoy by the Divine Bounty in this Life, abſolutely conclude what Good Things we ſhall enjoy in a futute State. And much leſs, ſince we are guilty of known Breaches of the Divine Laws, can we be ſure of the Remiſſion of Sins, and the Donation of Eternal Happineſs, ſince it depends upon the free Goodneſs of God, which is not determined by any neceſſary Rule of Action. A <hi>Deiſt</hi> therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects Pardon from God, juſt ſo as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Criminal hopes Forgiveneſs, from a mild and gracious Prince. He has ſome
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109220:71"/> General Notion, of the Good-Nature of his Soveraign, and therefore has ſome hopes it may be extended to him, as well as to others. But a Chriſtian has the ſame aſſurance of a conditional Forgiveneſs of Sins, as a Malefactor has, that Sees and Reads a Proclamation of Pardon, under the broad Seal of his offended Prince. Tho Miracles therefore are not neceſſary to ſupport material Beings, yet they are to aſſure mankind, of its Happineſs, and which do you think is of greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The Statelineſs of the Habitation, or the felicity of thoſe Rational Creatures that inhabit in it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> If Miracles were neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Happineſs of all mankind, why are not all men made Partakers of their Beneficial influence? Why muſt Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles be wrought only in ſome Ages of the World, and in the ſight too of only one Nation, not very Famous for War, or Learning? Why muſt all the Gentiles Periſh, becauſe they knew not a matter of Fact, that never was made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? Theſe are prejudices againſt your reveal'd Religion, which I can never conquer, and am therefore forc'd to fly from that confined Light, to the more diffuſive Light of Nature.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Whilſt man kept that integrity, wherein he was at firſt Created, there was no abſolute neceſſity of Miracles to make him happy, who was happy enough before in the Enjoyment of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. Nor was there any great need of Miracles, whilſt a traditionary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Decree of God, <hi>to ſave man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> was kept alive in the World, by the long Lives of the <hi>Ante-diluvian Patriarchs.</hi> But when all Fleſh had Corrupted their ways before God, and the Knowledge of one ſupreme Deity, which ſome will have to be a Connate Notion, was almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally eraced out of the minds of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as is evident from humane, as well as Divine <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> then it was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that God ſhould make a farther Revelation of himſelf, confirmed by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, without which it could not have had the force of a rational Evidence, <hi>To ſave mankind from utter perdition.</hi> And therefore, <hi>God firſt called upon the World by</hi> Noah, <hi>the 8th Preacher of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then called</hi> Abraham <hi>out of his Fathers Idolatrous Houſe, and made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, that he and his Seed, ſhould ſerve him.</hi> And when the State of the World required, that a manner of ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God ſhould be ſettled in it, tho not abſolutely beſt in its own Nature, yet
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109220:72"/> moſt ſuitable to the Genius of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that poſture of affairs, which was then Predominant in the World; the Wickedneſs and Folly of Man, in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Light of Nature, render'd it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>That</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhould be ſent to the Iſraelites, to bring them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>with Signs, and Wonders, and ſhew them after what manner God would then be Worſhipped.</hi> So that Miracles are neceſſary, firſt, when a new manner of Worſhip is to be planted in the World: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moſes</hi> was endued with the Power of Working Miracles, to convince the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> that the Ceremonial Law was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, tho additional to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Or Secondly, When the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhip is in danger of being loſt, <hi>And therefore</hi> Elijah <hi>and</hi> Eliſha <hi>in the Time of</hi> Ahab, <hi>when Idolatry made its greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon the true Religion, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Signs and Wonders from Heaven, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led back the Iſraelites, to the true Worſhip of the only God.</hi> Or Thirdly, When a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhip, that is of Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be alter'd, or diſannull'd, as was the Ceremonial Law by the coming of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But what muſt become of thoſe, who never ſaw nor heard of theſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Revelations?</p>

                  <hi>L.</hi> They have the Light of Nature, <hi>Let them uſe that well, and leave themſelves to the Mercy of God.</hi> The Scriptures no where ſay, <hi>That all thoſe who have not ſeen nor heard of a Miracle, ſhall be Damn'd, tho it teaches, that if they be ſav'd, it muſt be by Virtue of the Name of Jeſus.</hi> And therefore the ſtrength of your argument is quite loſt, unleſs you can prove that wild aſſertion. Beſides, the knowledge of reveal'd Religion, is not put up in ſo narrow a corner of the World, as men of your perſwaſion do ſeem to imagine. For there is no Nation, but what may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpel, if they pleaſe to liſten to its rational evidence, and I would feign know what injuſtice it is in God, to ſuffer them to Periſh, who either knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Miraculous Demonſtration of the Goſpel, make an ill uſe of the Light of Nature, or thoſe who hearing its rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal evidence, abuſe their reaſon in not conſenting to it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But ſtill you do not clear the main difficulty, objected by my Author, that the Power of Nature, is the very Power of God. How then can a Miracle be done by Natural Power?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Your Author firſt begs his Queſtion, and then very boldly Triumphs in the Victory, as if extorted by force of reaſon.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109220:73"/> He preſumes it granted as a firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>That there is no other God but Nature, and that this Nature is fixed and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not a free Agent, but a perpetual ſlave to fatal neceſſity.</hi> And thence ſtrongly concludes, <hi>That if there be no Power but that of Nature, then there can be</hi> (oh, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful demonſtration!) <hi>no ſupernatural Power.</hi> But we, on the other hand, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by a more plain and intelligible way of reaſoning. We ſuppoſe, That ſince Matter is a dull, unactive Principle, it could not make it ſelf, nor reduce it ſelf into that decent and uſeful order, in which now we ſee it. <hi>2d.</hi> That it was created by a Superiour Being: That that Superior Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be endued with all manner of Perfections, as being the firſt Cauſe of all Perfections in the Creature. 3. That <hi>Wiſdom, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> are Perfections, and therefore conſequently muſt be in the higheſt degree in him, who is the firſt Cauſe of them. And Laſtly, <hi>That his Wiſdom is ſeen in all the works of his hands.</hi> If therefore your Author would argue fairly againſt us, let him attack boldly any one of theſe Propoſitions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of God; and if we cannot defend them, we will become Worſhippers of the great Goddeſs Nature—But if God is an Underſtanding Being, he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109220:74"/> muſt be a free Agent: And if he be a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and free Agent, what ſhould hinder his ſtopping, or diſordering the regular courſe of Nature, when the doing ſo is conducive to his own Glory, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Benefit of all Mankind? Unleſs you can prove by Scripture, that he has ſworn by himſelf, he would never do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Does not my Author tell you, <hi>That it is a fooliſh thing to limit the power of Nature, and to ſay, her Laws extend to ſome things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not to all?</hi>

In complyance to his own Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, he muſt believe that the Courſe of Nature is ſettled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Hiſtorical Account of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he muſt believe that words can cure Diſeaſes, and raiſe the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet that the ſame words, ſpoken by another Perſon, cannot do it, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the Courſe of Nature is ſettled, and that it is not ſettled, but moves at random. He
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109220:77"/> muſt admit that one inanimate Body, Acts upon another only by contaction; And he muſt admit, that words have made alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in inanimate Bodys, which yet can cauſe no other contaction, than what ariſes from the modulation of the Air. He muſt believe it to be a Law of Nature, <hi>That the Dead cannot be raiſed up to Life, becauſe that is known to be above her uſual Courſe, and he muſt believe that the Dead have been reſtored to Life, by Virtue of a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> In ſhort, your Authors endeavour to ſolve Miracles by Natural cauſes, is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to the higheſt Degree, for he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks reveal'd Religion in that place, which is of all others moſt impregnable; if the Sparks of your Principles, did believe that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and our Saviour, did really do all thoſe mighty things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of them, by a due application of Natural cauſes, why do not they attempt to do the ſame? Or why do they laugh at all others who do attempt it, as Fools and Madmen? And how does it happen, that no ſuch things were ever well atteſted to have been done by other Perſons, who have made Experimental Philoſophy their ſtudy, with good ſucceſs? And how comes it to paſs, that they are repugnant and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable to all the Axioms of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, that hitherto have been Written,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:109220:78"/> that the more any Learned Man conſiders them, the more he finds of a Natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility in them? And why can't your Author find out as eaſy and probable a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, of all the <hi>Signs and Wonders,</hi> wrought by our Saviour, as of the ſtanding ſtill of the Sun, or the Paſſage of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> over the Red Sea?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> My Author is a wiſer Man, than to believe all the ſtrange Stories to be literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, which you read in your Bibles. He tells you, that whatſoever is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be done, which cannot poſſibly be aſcribed to Natural cauſes, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed as thruſt in by malicious deſigning men. And that in telling Wonders, the Scriptures ſpeak to the Fancy, but not to the Reaſon of mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Nothing ſpeaks leſs to the fancy, than the Chriſtian Religion, which in its Doctrines and Precepts too, is altogether perfective of humane reaſon. But if your Author denies his aſſent to the Hiſtorical part of the Bible, and only in ſome places pretends to give it, to pleaſe the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> why does he give no reaſon for his diſſent? For one ſubſtantial reaſon, would be ſufficient in this caſe, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole bulk of reveal'd Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Why does he not ſhew, that no man can have any certainty of any matter of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109220:78"/> Fact, unleſs he ſee it done with his own Eyes? Why does he not prove that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and probity of Witneſſes are no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient motives to aſſent? VVhy does he not produce ſome Teſtimonies of Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that may invalidate the credit of theſe, who have recorded the Miracles of our <hi>B. S.</hi> or of his Apoſtles? There is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no more obvious way of ruining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion, than the diſproving thoſe relations of Miracles, upon which its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Evidence, is moſt ſtrongly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Either therefore your Author could find nothing to ſay on this topick, or elſe through inadvertency, he has omitted thoſe Arguments, which are moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to ſupport ſo bad a cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> It is enough that he demonſtrated before, that the Power of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being the ſame, there can be no ſuch thing as a Miracle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> An Hiſtorical Account, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in an Hiſtorical manner, not by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Arguments, which have no force to refute a matter of Fact. We urge the Teſtimony of a ſufficient Number of highly creditable Witneſſes, that Miracles have been done; your Author denys all, becauſe according to his reaſon, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any ſuch thing ſhould be. This is juſt as if a blind man ſhould endeavour
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109220:79"/> to confute all thoſe who teſtify there is ſuch a thing as light, by giving his reaſons that oblige him to think, that there can be no ſuch thing. VVhen a thing is well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to have been done, it is a vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make men Renounce their ſenſes, in complyance to his reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You think you have gained a great point, when you have brought a man to acknowledge, the reality of your boaſted Miracles; But alas, you fight for that which can do you no good when you have gain'd it. For Miracles can never make us underſtand, either the Eſſence or Exiſtence, or Providence of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> According to my Notion of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it is a work that is done by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Finger of God, and that a work we know to be done by God alone, ſhould not ſo much as render us certain of the Exiſtence of a God, is to me an unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Riddle. Again, a Miracle is a work that we know cannot be done, according to the Mechanical Laws of matter and motion, but is therefore aſcribed to a free, Spiritual and Powerful Agent, and yet that all this ſhould be no demonſtration of the Spirituality, Freedom, and Power of the Divine Nature, is to me the 2d part of the ſame Riddle. Again, a miracle is a work that is wrought, to give ſome men
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109220:79"/> a Teſtimonial, that they are ſent on ſome errand by God, to his Creature man, and yet that this ſhould be no Argument of Gods Providence, nor at all prove that he takes any care of mankind, is the third and laſt part of the Riddle, which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg you would be pleaſed to unfold to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> That I will, and very briefly too. We gather the Exiſtence of God, from known and received Notions, but if there were any ſuperiour Power, that could alter theſe Notions, it muſt neceſſarily deſtroy the very knowledge of a God, or at leaſt compel us to doubt of his Exiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> It is not by Miracles, but by the very light of Nature that we underſtand, that there is a Being, ſuperiour to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, who can alter them for the better or the worſe, according as he pleaſes. But then the ſame reaſon tells us, that Truth is one of his moſt adorable perfections, and from thence we conclude, that he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us right Faculties, and will not become the Author of deceit. But it ſeems, your Author thinks, that he can never be ſecure of the Truth of his Faculties, if he ſhould once believe that there is a God, who is a Powerful and Voluntary Agent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> No, there is a further reaſon, for if any thing be repugnant to Nature, it is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109220:80"/> repugnant to thoſe firſt Principles, from whence we conclude the Exiſtence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf. And what certainty is there, if you deſtroy firſt Principles?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> A Miracle is ſo far from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to firſt Principles, that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether declarative of them. Is it not to be admitted as a firſt Principle in reaſon, <hi>That there is a God who made the World?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Heavens forbid I ſhould deny it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> And that can annihilate the World?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I ſee no reaſon to deny it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If then alteration of ſome part of the Univerſe, be leſs than annihilation, you muſt grant it poſſible, and what then is there in a Miracle, that is repugnant to the firſt and moſt obvious Principles of Reaſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But he tells you, that whether a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle be a work, either which proceeds from Natural cauſes, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, or has no other cauſe than the immediate Will of God, yet ſtill it exceeds the reach of humane underſtanding, and we can underſtand nothing from that, which exceeds the very Standard of our Faculties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> There is nothing in a Miracle, that exceeds the bounds of humane underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but only the manner of the Divine Operation in the Production of it. Our
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109220:80"/> ſenſes bear Witneſs that the work is done, and our reaſon concludes, that none but God could do it. But we do not know the manner of the Divine Operation: Nor no more do we comprehend the manner of the Divine Operation in the Creation of the World; but does it therefore follow, that Creation, becauſe it exceeds the bounds of humane underſtanding, can give us no true knowledge of the Eſſence, Exiſtence, or Providence of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I cannot well anſwer your laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in the <hi>72d</hi> page, I think my <hi>Author</hi> argues very well; <hi>viz. That if any thing was done, above the power of Nature, or contrary to Nature, it would be repugnant to that Order, which God has appointed by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Laws to be eternal; and the belief of ſuch a thing would make us doubt of all things, and bring us at laſt to Atheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> And pray why ſo? What do you underſtand by Nature, but thoſe <hi>Laws of Motion by which God does preſerve the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in that Beauty and Order wherein we now enjoy it?</hi> Theſe we acknowledge to be ſufficient to give us knowledge of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and Wiſdom of God, vvhich vvould be knovvn by the <hi>Work of his hands,</hi> tho there vvere no ſuch thing as a <hi>Miracle.</hi> Nor do vve ſay, <hi>That a Miracle is abſolutely neceſſary to puniſh ill men, or to reward the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:109220:81"/> good;</hi> God can do that by his Providence, and the ſetled Courſe and Order of things: And though God does it by <hi>Miracles</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, yet that is not for <hi>want of Power to do it otherwiſe,</hi> but only that theſe <hi>Miracles</hi> may the more be conſidered as <hi>Teſtimonials of a Divine Miſſion.</hi> Tho therefore the frequent interruption of the ſetled Courſe of Nature, would render the Endeavours of thoſe Vain, who gave their minds to the ſtudy of <hi>Natural Philoſophy;</hi> yet the interruption of it at ſome certain <hi>Times and Seaſons,</hi> when God is pleaſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſome particular meſſage to mankind, is <hi>no obſtruction to the ſtudy of Nature,</hi> and is a great and neceſſary introduction to a compleater knowledge of the Will of God. For what proportion of time is there between the Miraculous Ages of <hi>Moſes</hi> and our Saviour, and the duration of the VVorld? And how ſmall is the Number of well atteſted Miracles, in reſpect to all the other works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Suppoſe there were real Miracles, yet my Author proves from Scripture, that they can lead us into no true Knowledge of God. <hi>For a Prophet of the falſe Gods, might work Signs, and Wonders, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be Stoned for his pains.</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3. Verſes.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:109220:81"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> A Miracle is an appeal to our ſenſes, that what is done, is not done by any Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or Material Being. But becauſe there are Bad, as well as Good Inviſible Agents, we are to Judge of the reality of a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, by the Good or ill Doctrines, which it is alledged to ſupport. The <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the <hi>Pagan Prieſts</hi> in all Ages, alledged Miracles, to deſtroy the true Notion of a God, and to looſen all the ſacred Bonds of Morality, but neither were theſe Miracles well atteſted, nor were they to be regarded, becauſe they tended only to deſtroy and corrupt Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, and Natural honeſty too. And indeed the <hi>Pagan</hi> Superſtition, ſeems to me to have been nothing elſe but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Revelation of certain Names of Deities, Rites, and Ceremonies, as might keep men furtheſt from God, and corrupt that <hi>Idea</hi> of him, which is eaſy enough to be deduced from the Light of Nature. It is very plain, that they knew not the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of their own Religious Rites and Ceremonies, for ſo ſays <hi>Antigone</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles.</hi>

               <p>Nor indeed, is it any wonder that they ſhould not know the Original of thoſe Rites and Ceremonies; which have no Foundation in Nature, nor were ſo much as of humane inſtitution, but ſhuffled into the world by the Tricks and Impoſtures of Evil Spirits. But tho Evil Spirits may be Authors of ſome things that look like Propheſies, Miracle, or Inſpiration, yet they never can nor will do any thing to eſtabliſh a Religion, that gives a true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and Teaches a rational wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of him, and tends to the good and benefit of mankind. If therefore we have diſtinct Notions of Moral Good and Evil, and of Natural Religion, we muſt have diſtinct Notions of the uſual Effects of Good and of Evil Spirits. The <hi>Jews</hi> were very ſenſible, that one Evil Spirit might by Colluſion give place, or at leaſt ſeem to give place to another; and thence maliciouſly concluded, <hi>That our Saviour caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:109220:83"/> to be very much for the honour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion, <hi>That the Worſhip of one God, was not the Legal Religion of any one Nation, but that of the</hi> Jews <hi>only.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> No more ought your Author ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to conclude, that becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of ſome Natural things, as done by God, therefore God never works in a Supernatural manner. <hi>For tho</hi> Saul

                  <hi>ſeems to be led to</hi> Samuel <hi>by Natural cauſes, yet the prediction to</hi> Samuel, <hi>that</hi> Saul <hi>ſhould certainly come to him, that he ſhould be King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>muſt needs be aſcribed to a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Power. The Heart of the</hi> Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>was turned againſt the Children of</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>becauſe they feared their Numbers;</hi> But <note place="margin">Exod. 1.</note> what natural reaſon can be given of all thoſe other Signs and Wonders, which are reckoned up in the ſame <hi>Pſalm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I muſt confeſs ingenuouſly, that if all things were done by <hi>Moſes</hi> and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in that exact manner, according to which they are related, it is impoſſible to give a ſolution of them by Natural cauſes, eſpecially, if Natural cauſes do always work in a fixt and unmoveable order. But my Author very judiciouſly ſhews, that there are many Circumſtances in a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which the Scriptures do omit, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when they are Sung in a Poetic Stile, which if they were expreſſed, would plainly ſhew, that what we now admire as Supernatural, was only an effect of Natural cauſes: And not only ſo, but many Circumſtances of the Miracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, do ſhew that they required Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes, to bring them to perfection. See <hi>Exod. 9. v. 10. Moſes could not bring boyls upon the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>without firſt throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Aſhes in the Air.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.

                  <hi>L.</hi> A tedious relation of impertinent Circumſtances, is avoided by all Judicious, and Faithful Hiſtorians. But to omit Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that are material, and the Knowledge of which alters the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Denomination of an Action, is a Trick only of knaves and impoſtors. If therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> in thoſe Books which are plainly Hiſtorical, did deſignedly omit thoſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Action, which would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the world, that thoſe were only the Works of Nature, which they would make the world believe were the very immediate Works of God, whatever cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit their Writings might have met with in After-Ages, they could have found none in their own. For the <hi>Jews</hi> that ſaw what was done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> would have known by the Circumſtances of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:109220:84"/> that were deſignedly omitted, that whatever he might pretend, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, but what was effected by the ſole Power of Nature: And how then could he have perſwaded the <hi>Jews</hi> of his own Age, that he was ſent from God? Or how could he have made ſo many falſe Revelations publick, in the ſight of the whole Nation? And why ſhould they be ſuch Fools, as to erect a Government in Church and State, upon a Foundation, which they of that Age muſt needs have known to be too weak to ſupport it? With what Face could our Saviour, tell the <hi>Jews</hi> of his Age, that his works teſtify'd of him, if there was nothing in them Miraculous, but what was made ſo to appear by the partial and the unfaithful Relation of his own Friends and Diſciples. It is a falſe Inſinuation of your Author, that Miracles are for the moſt part Sung in a Poetick manner; for they are hiſtorically related, as motives to the credibility of reveal'd Religion; and tho ſome of them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> yet the very Poetick Stile of <hi>David,</hi> does not render them more wonderful, than the plain Hiſtorical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But with what impudence, if not affected ignorance, does your Author Affirm, that the Circumſtances of ſome Actions, recorded as Miracles in Scripture,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:109220:85"/> do ſhew that they were effected by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes. <hi>When</hi> Moſes <hi>brought a Boyl upon the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>by throwing up Aſhes into the Air, the Action was as Miraculous, as if without throwing up the Aſhes, he had only in the Name of God, commanded the Boyl to ſeize upon the Bodies of the</hi> Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 10. v.</note> Unleſs your Author can Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally prove, that according to the ſetled Courſe and Order of Nature, of which he prates ſo much, one man by ſcattering a little Duſt or Aſhes in the Air, might bring Scabs and Boyls to infeſt a whole Nation, We read, <hi>That the Locusts came upon the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>with a ſtrong</hi> Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, <hi>and were driven away with a</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, <note place="margin">Exod. 10. v. 14. v. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>both were done at the lifting up of the Rod, and the intreaty of</hi> Moſes, <hi>which we all know, are no Natural means of bringing up, or driving away the</hi> Locuſts, <hi>but ſuch as render'd the Action as Miraculous, as if God had Created</hi> Locuſts, <hi>in the ſight of the</hi> Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <hi>to plague them.</hi> The like is to be ſaid <hi>of our Saviours curing the blind man, by anointing his Eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:109220:85"/> Prophets, and our <hi>S.</hi> where it does at all oppoſe his Doctrine of Material, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal neceſſity; and therefore ſince he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges no reaſons for his diſſent, I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge none to refute him, but refer you for ſatisfaction to thoſe many Excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, that have been wrote upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> My Author ſhews, that your own Bibles do aſſert, that the Courſe of Nature is fixed and immutable. So you read in the <hi>148th Pſalm. He hath alſo Establiſhed them,</hi> (i. e. the heavens) <hi>for ever and ever; he hath made a decree which ſhall not paſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> All that you can infer from hence, is this, <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Heavens are of a long duration the <hi>Hebrews</hi> making no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Eternity and a very long Continuation of Time. Or at moſt, that ſome of the Coeleſtial Bodys, will not be diſſolved and that the very Heavens are ſo Subject to the Decrees and Laws of God, that no caſual Concourſe of Atoms, ſhall be able to reſiſt his will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But Pray obſerve the Words of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> the greateſt Philoſopher of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 9, and 10. verſes. <hi>The thing which hath been, it is that which ſhall be, and that which is done, is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the Sun. 10. Is there any thing whereof it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109220:86"/> may be ſaid, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which hath been before us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If you would be pleaſed to caſt your Eye upon the 8th verſe of that Chapter, you will find that <hi>Solomon</hi> is there ſpeaking of the toyl, labour, and ſatiety of all Worldly Enjoyments, in which nothing is New, but the old Vexations of Humane Life, return continually upon us—as <hi>Virgil</hi> not unaptly expreſſes it,</p>
               <q>—Redit labor actus in Orbem.</q>
               <p>But here is not one word, that has any relation to Miracles, nor can by any force of reaſon be diſtorted to that ſenſe. For ſuppoſe <hi>Solomons</hi> meaning is, that nothing was New in his Time, nor would be for the future, what is this to the Doctrine of Miracles? for Miracles were no New Things in the Time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> for they commenced almoſt with the beginning of the World, and therefore they might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen again and again, and yet no new thing be done in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But what think you, of the 14th verſe of the third Chapter of <hi>Eccleſ. I know that whatſoever God doeth, it ſhall be for ever, nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it, and God doeth it, that men ſhould fear before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:109220:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I think thereby <hi>Solomon</hi> declares what we all acknowledge, <hi>viz. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Stability of all the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which nothing can alter but the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Power of God, by whom all things were at firſt Created.</hi> But I can never think, that <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had right conceptions of God, could mean thereby, that God had diveſted himſelf of the Power of Acting contrary to the Laws of Motion of his own making. But only that he does it ſeldom, and not to ſupport the Univerſe, which might continue as it is without it, but to transfer ſome part of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to thoſe who are Commiſſioned by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I muſt Ingenuouſly confeſs, you have removed ſeveral of thoſe prejudices, which I have imbibed from this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and I begin to ſee more of the reaſonableneſs of aſſenting to reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than I had before conſidered. But ſtill I would beg your aſſiſtance, to diſpel two doubts, which do much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, ſince Natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is grounded upon Reaſon, why is it not a better guide to Happineſs than reveal'd Religion, which ſtands altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon an Hiſtorical baſis?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:109220:87"/>2. If the way to happineſs is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures, which is the beſt way to come to a right underſtanding of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> You impoſe a greater task upon me, than I am able to undergo, after ſo long a fatigue. But if you think it worthy your labour, to meet me at any other convenient Time, I will deliver my Thoughts upon thoſe Subjects, with all the brevity and perſpicuity, that you can expect from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Your propoſal is fair and generous; I will wait your leiſure to morrow Morning; in the mean time all Happineſs attend you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Yes, I have, and hope to make it evident unto you, that without Divine Revelation, we had been involved in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and miſery, and that the Light of Nature, could not have ſhew'd us the way to true Happineſs.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:109220:87"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> That is the thing I deſire to hear from you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I hope, you will grant, that the Soul is immortal, and at leaſt capable of a laſting Happineſs or Miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I was always one of thoſe <hi>Deiſts,</hi> which never did deny it; altho I know there are ſome who very confidently do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> And that the mind of Man cannot be very happy, till it be pretty ſecure of laſting Joys in a future State, or at leaſt freed from the danger of Living in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual torments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I muſt confeſs this to be true, of all thoſe who give themſelves any tolerable liberty of thinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Then you will grant alſo, that the greater certainty men have, both of what true Happineſs is, and how it may be obtained, ſo much the better it is for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> None can doubt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Then it follows, that the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Natural Light, by Revelation, is one of the greateſt Benefits that God can in this World beſtow upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But what Confirmation can reaſon receive from Hiſtory? This ſeems to me, to be like the Suns receiving Light from a farthing Candle.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:109220:88"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> To underſtand this well, we muſt conſider, that there are as it were 3 Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums of certainty, by which the mind of Man arrives to the Knowledge of Truth. The firſt is Reaſon, which apprehends common, plain, and univerſal Notions, and draws right concluſions from them. The ſecond is Senſe, by which we Judge of the Truth of Matters of Fact, and are certain of what Impreſſions External objects do make upon our Organs, tho it does diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us, the true Nature of things, and the third is Revelation, to which we aſſent, becauſe we are aſſured it comes from God, the Fountain of Truth: Now tho Reaſon and Senſe, are the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums of certainty in the works of Nature, with which the Scriptures do not directly meddle, yet Reaſon is defective in ſhewing us the way to ſupernatural Happineſs in two reſpects. Firſt, becauſe many things belonging thereunto, are not deducible from reaſon alone. And Secondly, becauſe many things that are deducible from thence, in their own Nature, yet are not Actually deduced by the Generality of Mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Pray, Sir, a little Explanation: You ſeem now like <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> to walk upon the Clouds.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:109220:88"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> It is not deducible from reaſon alone, that God will never annihilate the Soul; Or what will be its future State, or that he will forgive great Sins, upon condition of Repentance; or that there are 3 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Trinity; or that the Son of God would be Incarnate in the Fleſh; or make ſatisfaction for Sins; with other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the like Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But it is deducible, that there is a God, and that he is to be lov'd, and fear'd, and that our Neighbour is not to be injur'd, and that temperance is conducive to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve health, wealth, and reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> But you muſt obſerve, that not one half of Natural Religion, or Morality, that is deducible from reaſon, was ever actually thence deduced by one half of mankind. What is more obvious to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than the Unity and Spirituality of the Godhead, and what was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all over the World, than the worſhip of many Deities and Corporeal Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Gods? What attribute in the Divine Nature ſhines more illuſtriouſly to the Eye of Reaſon, than Univerſal Love and Benignity? <hi>And yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not the</hi> Pagans <hi>from burning their Children to</hi> Moloch, <hi>and giving the Fruit of their Bodys, for the Sins of their Souls.</hi> How few were there amongſt their very Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109220:89"/> who believed the immortality of the Soul? and ſome of them deny'd the difference between Moral Good and Evil.</p>
               <q>Nec natura poteſt juſto ſecernere iniquum.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Prethee add no more, I am ſatisfy'd that the greateſt part of mankind, live more by ſenſe than by reaſon; and that they never uſe their reaſon any further, than juſt to ſerve the uſes of the Animal Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Tho therefore reaſon is Natural to all Men, yet it does not follow, that all men are endued with all poſſible degrees of Natural knowledge in Morality, any more than in Mathematicks, where all is deducible from plain and obvious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and yet very few are well verſed in that Noble Science.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Why, will you ſay, that there is a greater certainty in Revelation, than in Reaſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Yes, there is: For Miracles are as ſo many Appeals, both to ſenſe and to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too. The ſenſes hear, or ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done, which reaſon tells 'em, is done by the inviſible Power of God, and if by God, then Signs of a Divine Miſſion, in the Perſon that performs them, and if the Miſſion be Divine, the ſame reaſon tells us,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109220:89"/> that the meſſage muſt needs be true. So that Miracles give Teſtimony to Divine Miſſion. 1. If they be wrought openly, and the effects permanent, to diſtinguiſh them from jugling Tricks and Impoſtures. 2. If they are directly repugnant to ſome known and univerſal Law of Nature, to diſtinguiſh them from mere Natural Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. 3. If they are brought to give Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to ſuch Doctrines, as are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Natural Religion, or good manners, to diſtinguiſh them from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of Evil and Malicious Spirits. And 4<hi>ly,</hi> When they are agreeable to Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which like ſo many lines, tho drawn at ſeveral times, tend to one center, as it hapned in the Perſon of our <hi>B. S.</hi> now it is evident, that when ſenſe and reaſon both conſpire together, and Act as it were in conſort, it forces the aſſent of all ſorts and degrees of men, more ſtrongly than dry ſpeculation: And therefore ſince it is neceſſary for the Good of Man, that the Will of God ſhould be known, it was convenient it ſhould be made known in ſuch a manner, as would convince the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Learned, and the very ſenſes of the leſs thinking part of mankind, and this could be done no other way ſo commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as by Propheſie and Miracles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Your reaſon, good Sir, for that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> If ſome things neceſſary to be known, are not deducible from reaſon, as it is now, would you have thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that God ſhould have quite alter'd the frame of humane Nature, and given new faculties to diſcern his Will?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> No, that would have been too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a force upon the mind—I do not like that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Would you have had him ſpoken in a ſupernatural way to all mankind? By an immediate voice from Heaven?</p>
               <p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I cannot ſee how that could have mended the matter; for I can no more frame a Notion of certainty in bare Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than in the Hieroglyphical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations made to the Ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Would you have had him ſent his Meſſengers on his Errands, without any viſible Power of Propheſie or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, to be believ'd upon their bare word?</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:109220:90"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> He might, if it had pleas'd him; but then I do believe very few would have given them credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Would you have Miracles wrought every day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I ſhould be glad to ſee a Miracle, or two, for my own ſatisfaction: But I muſt confeſs, if they were very frequent, they would not in a ſhort time be diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Works of Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Then I perceive you <hi>Sceptiſts</hi> deſire ſomething, but you know not what. For, give your thoughts the utmoſt liberty of ranging, yet you will never find a more commodious way of Gods ſpeaking to mankind, than that which is recorded in the Scriptures; becauſe it is fuited to all the faculties of the Soul, and is apt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to force the aſſent of all mankind: And if we conſider the ſubject matter of it, we ſhall find, that it reveals to man all thoſe neceſſary Truths, which are no ways deducible from reaſon alone; and Secondly, it gives light, perſpicuity and luſter, to all thoſe Moral Duties, which are indeed deducible by operoſe deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from reaſon, but have not been thence Actually deduced by the leſs thinking part of mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I ſhould have a better Opinion of Scripture, if you could give me ſome
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109220:91"/> rules, of interpreting thoſe Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; for I had rather go to no Oracle, than to an Oracle that has a double mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> The obſcurity of the Scriptures, is very much inſiſted upon by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> to make room for an infallible guide and interpreter; and from them taken up by the <hi>Deiſts,</hi> to deſtroy all the whole frame of reveal'd Religion. But the Scripture is neither ſo obſcure, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, nor ſo abſurd as you <hi>Deiſts</hi> do make it. And Firſt, I think it would be very much to the purpoſe, to reduce Scripture to thoſe ſeveral heads of the Subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is contained in them. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> For ſome things are the pure and proper objects of humane reaſon, in which Natural Religion and Revelation, are not at all concerned; ſuch as are the motion of the Earth or Heavens, and other <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>'s of the works of Nature. Of theſe it is not neceſſary, that the Scripture ſhould ſpeak in the moſt proper, and the moſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical terms. It is enough that it excites us to our duty, by the contemplation of their Beauty and Order; and therefore your Author's Obſervation of the Errors of the Author of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Hiſtory, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of the Sun, is little to the purpoſe, unleſs he can prove, it was the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:109220:91"/> deſign of that book, to give us a ſyſtem of Aſtronomy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Other things in the Scripture deliver'd, are matters of pure Revelation, which reaſon could never diſcover, but receives them as additions to it. Such as are the Doctrine of the Trinity, Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sacraments, and the like, which my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in his Book, <hi>de augmentis ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum,</hi> wiſhes reduced into one Body, that ſo we might diſtinctly view, what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is altogether ſupported by Divine Revelation, and what is owing to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring rules of humane reaſon: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is deliver'd by Revelation, is to be received with the ſame firmneſs of aſſent, as a firſt Principle, but with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we may ſafely venture to draw legitimate concluſions, from firſt Principles of reaſon; but we muſt be more modeſt in matters of mere Revelation, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we wade beyond our depth. For here we muſt acquieſce in nothing but the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Other matters are intelligible, by Reaſon and by Revelation too, as viſible by a double Light. Thus the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Decalogue, excepting only the Circumſtantial part, of the preciſe time of worſhip in the Sabbath, and our Saviour's Divine Sermon in the Mount, and other
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109220:92"/> precepts of morality, are ſo many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Natural Religion. Revelation only confirms, what reaſon, as it were, gueſſed at before, and makes that obvious to the meaneſt capacity, which before was known to the more thinking part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and adds the certainty of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, which alone can engage a man to act with vigour. And therefore we rightly enough interpret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties, by known Principles of humane reaſon. For otherwiſe, we ſhould run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many abſurdities, by adhering to the very Letter of the Decalogue its ſelf. If we do not interpret the 2d Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this manner, every Picture in our Houſes, every Sign in our Streets, would be ſo many breaches of the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any Graven Image, nor the Likeneſs of any thing,</hi> &amp;c. All Executions of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and ſlaying of men in a juſt War, would be downright Murthers, if the Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> was to be taken in a ſtrict and literal ſenſe, nay, the Scriptures would contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when in ſome caſes, they command Criminals to be put to Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Other things are Matters of Hiſtory. Such as are the Narrations of what hapned to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109220:92"/> and Miracles were wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. And of theſe we Judge, as of other Matters of Fact, <hi>Viz.</hi> By the Number and Credibility of Witneſſes. And here we appeal to the common ſenſe of mankind, for theſe Miracles which are Hiſtory to us, to thoſe who ſaw them, were matters of ſenſe. <hi>The Wiſdom of God, is wrapt up in the Scriptures,</hi> as it is in the works of Nature, and is thence to be deduced, by obſerving Method and Order, without which all things appear to the underſtanding, without ſhape, or beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Is this all you would adviſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> No. I would be glad to ſee, if the work were poſſible, an Authentick Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Synchronical, with all parts of thoſe ſacred Writings. For want of this, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have carp'd at <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory, who yet can find out nothing ſo Ancient, nor ſo agreeable to all the remnants of paſt events, that were preſerved in the Fables or Hiſtories of <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers. Where we have a Synchronical Hiſtory, it agrees very well with the Propheſies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and no doubt, but if an Account could be found, of whatever hapned to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations about <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> it would clear many Paſſages in the other Prophets, which now ſeem triffling, abſurd, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:109220:93"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> What do you think, of an exact Knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, and all the Idioms of that Language?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I think it very uſeful, but that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is ſufficiently ſupplied to the Vulgar, by faithful Tranſlations of Learned Men. I therefore in the laſt place would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, what is touched upon by your Author, an exact Hiſtory of the Books of the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> By whom written, for what end, at what time, what was the Natural diſpoſition, abilities, and qualities of the reſpective Pen-Men (for Authors I muſt not call them) with other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the like Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Then I perceive you will agree with my Author in the manner of interpreting, tho not in the Divine Authority, of thoſe ſacred Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> So far as it agrees with truth and no farther. I approve of a Collection of thoſe places that ſeem to agree, and of thoſe which ſeem to be moſt repugnant. But <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid</hi> p. 86.</note> then I do not infer from thence, that the Opinions of the ſacred Writers were really repugnant; becauſe then ſome of them muſt have been falſe, and to aſcribe falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to inſpired Writers, is the ſame thing as to aſcribe it to God himſelf: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find no ſeeming oppoſition in thoſe Writings, which may not be reconciled,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109220:93"/> by an exact knowledge of the Language, compariſon with the Context, and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the true Scope and Deſign of Holy Perſons. As for what your Author ſays, that we are not to reject the literal ſenſe of any inſpired Pen Men, becauſe it is abſurd, ſince in ſpeculative matters they are guilty of great abſurdities, it is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a rational Man. In thoſe things indeed, which are intelligible from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon as well as Revelation, if any thing is plainly abſurd and impoſſible to reaſon, we may and ought to fly to a Metaphorical ſenſe and meaning. But we muſt not do ſo in matters of mere Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they being deducible from no Principle of Reaſon, we are not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of what is abſurd or poſſible in them, but we give aſſent to them, for no other cauſe, than becauſe they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by God. Nor do I wiſh for an Hiſtorical Account, of the Lives and Diſpoſitions of the Ancient Prophets, that from thence, like your Author, I may aſcribe what I think to be erroneous, to the Education, Ignorance, or Stupidity of the Prophet, becauſe Inſpiration equals the underſtandings of Men, and leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Natural abilities, but only the manner of expreſſion; And that I muſt confeſs, might be gueſſed at from ſuch an
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109220:94"/> Hiſtorical Account of the Books, and the reſpective Pen-Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I have heard you hitherto, with ſome delight and ſatisfaction, but I fear you will not be able, to aſſign any better method of interpreting Scripture, than that which is propounded by my judicious Author. For as nothing unfolds Nature better than a Natural-Hiſtory, ſo is Scripture beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by a Hiſtory of the Scripture it ſelf. And this Hiſtory muſt not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Properties and Idioms of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Languages, in which they were at firſt Written, (of which we have diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſomething already) but ſecondly, a Collection of the ſentences of each Book, which are reducible to the ſame General Head; that ſo Scripture may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by any Notions of reaſon, but by ſentences Collected from its ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I cannot ſee how this can at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the deſign of the Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Then I will open your underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with a clear inſtance. <hi>Moſes ſays in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>one place, that God is a fire, and in another, that he is a Jealous God.</hi> Now you Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, would preſently conclude, that fire was to be taken in a Metaphorical ſenſe, becauſe it is contrary to Natural reaſon, to think, <hi>That an immaterial God, ſhould be a material fire:</hi> Not conſidering, <hi>that</hi> Moſes
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109220:94"/> 
                  <hi>might teach, that God is a fire, tho that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>is abſurd, and contrary to reaſon.</hi> And unleſs the word fire, in the 31ſt of <hi>Job</hi> and the 12th verſe, had been put to ſignify wrath or Jealouſy, nothing had been more plain, <hi>Than that</hi> Moſes <hi>had taught the</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, <hi>that God was a fire,</hi> i. e. <hi>the refined part of the moſt ſublimated Aether.</hi> Now ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> teaches that God is Jealous, and the Scripture no where ſays, <hi>That he is void of Paſſions, thence we may conclude, that</hi> Moſes <hi>did believe, or at leaſt was willing to make the ſimple</hi> Iſraelites <hi>believe, that there</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vid. ſig.</note> 
                  <hi>are the ſame Paſſions in God as there are in Man.</hi> And pray conſider, how many Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities there would be in the Chriſtian Religion, if you <hi>Divines,</hi> in Propoſitions repugnant to common Senſe, did not (to ſave the Credit of your own Profeſſion) fly from a Literal to a Metaphorical Senſe and Meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> That Scripture is very well expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Scripture, in moſt Caſes, is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which we are more fond to defend than your very Author; but yet we are unwilling to exclude that uſe of <hi>common Senſe and Reaſon,</hi> without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to underſtand the meaneſt Author. When we read any <hi>Hiſtorian, Orator,</hi> or <hi>Poet,</hi> we readily gueſs what words are uſed in a proper, and what in a Tranſlated
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109220:95"/> ſenſe, by the very contexture and poſition of the words, without turning over the whole Hiſtory, Poem, or Oration, to find out a Metaphor, or Catacreſis, that lies open to the firſt view of the Reader. And let any Man read the 23d of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and the 23d and 24th verſes, and Judge whether <hi>Moſes</hi> therein could be conceived as teaching the <hi>Iſraelites, That God is a real fire, tho</hi> Job <hi>had never ſpake one word of the matter. 23. Take heed to your ſelves, leſt you forget the Covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make you a Graven Image, or the likeneſs of any thing, which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee. 24. For the Lord thy God is a Conſuming Fire, even a Jealous God.</hi> How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>That</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhould be conceived as teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>that God is real Fire, when in the ſame breath he forbids them to make any likeneſs of him; which the</hi> Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites <hi>muſt needs have done, every time they ſtruck a light, or went to</hi> Oven, <hi>if God had been a real fire.</hi> Suppoſe <hi>Job</hi> had never us'd the word fire in all his complaints, could not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> have underſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he expreſſes the Activity, and Vehemence of Gods Indignation againſt Idolatry, in ſuch plain words? <hi>Viz. Thy God is a Conſuming Fire, even a Jealous God.</hi> Beſides, with what impudence, does your
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109220:95"/> Author, expound <hi>Moſes</hi> by <hi>Job,</hi> when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">p. 9.</note> to his <hi>Canons</hi> of Interpretation, <hi>Non licet mentem unius Prophetae, ex locis clarioribus alterius concludere neque explicare, niſi evident iſſime conſtet, eos unam eandemque foviſſe ſententiam—We muſt not conclude the mind of one Prophet, from the more expreſs places of another, unleſs we are certain that both were of the ſame Opinion.</hi> And again he tells us, in the 95th page, that we muſt not hope to ſolve all repugnancies in the scriptures, by comparing one place with another, ſince that only can illuſtrate ſome few places by chance, <hi>Quando quidem nullus propheta eo fine ſcripſit ut verba alterius aut ſua ipſa ex profeſſo explicaret.</hi> No Prophet wrote on purpoſe to explain his own, or another Prophets meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Methinks it is ſomething odd, to ſay, <hi>That no Prophet wrote any thing to explain his own meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> It is no other than your Author ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes upon you, under the name of <hi>ſolid Reaſon,</hi> whereas he is full of Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſeems never to know his own mind. In the 87<hi>th. Pag.</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the illogical deduction of a univerſal Propoſition, from a ſingle inſtance, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from this paſſage of <hi>Moſes, That the knowledge of the Scriptures is to be Deduced only from themſelves;</hi> but from the very
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:109220:96"/> next Line, to the end of the <hi>Chap.</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends earneſtly to prove, <hi>That the knowledge of the true Sence of the Scriptures, is to be gained not from the Books themſelves, but from an Hiſtory of the Books, and the various chances that have hapned to them, viz.</hi> a Narration of the Lives, Manners, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the reſpective Pen-Men, who they were, at what time, to whom, and upon what occaſion they wrote each Book; ſo that according to your Author, the Interpretation of Scripture is to be taken <note place="margin">ex ſolis biblii.</note> from the Scriptures alone, and yet without ſuch an extrinſick Hiſtory, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes to be wanting, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know the true ſenſe of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> I muſt confeſs, that my Author is a little too guilty of contradicting himſelf, for great wits have ſhort memories: But ſtill you do not ſhew any Reaſon, why we ſhould not believe <hi>that God, in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of</hi> Moſes, <hi>was ſubject to Humane Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> ſince it is no where contradicted in the Scriptures themſelves,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Becauſe the Scriptures themſelves do teach, <hi>That God is a Spirit, John</hi> 4. 24. and that conſequently, he cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Paſſions, which are always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome Perturbations of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and ſince by Nature we have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and Adaequate Comprehenſion of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109220:96"/> the Principles, and manner of Operation of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> in diſtributing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and Puniſhments, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>Moſes</hi> to expreſs God's firſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution <hi>of rewarding the Good, and puniſhing the Bad,</hi> in more proper terms than thoſe of Love and Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho therefore thoſe Expreſſions are Figurative, when applied to God, yet ſince they are the moſt proper that we can find, for what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully underſtand, it is plain that <hi>Moſes</hi> had right Conceptions of God, when in words, he aſcrib'd thoſe Paſſions to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Then you interpret Scripture by Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I do not make my Reaſon, the Standard of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> but I hope, that I may make the ſame uſe of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in Interpreting Scripture, as you, or any ſenſible Man would do, in Reading any Humane Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> It would be hard to deny you that liberty; beſides I am ſo much a Friend to Truth, that I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that it is not plain to me, that <hi>Job</hi> in that place by Fire, does either underſtand Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Job 31.</note> or Anger, but rather the crime of <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Fornication,</hi> for thus he ſpeaks, <hi>v. 9. If my heart hath been deceived by a Woman, or if I have laid wait at my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours door; Then let my Wife grind unto an

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> And yet your admired Author, makes uſe of ſuch forc't Interpretations of Scripture, to affix abſurdities of his own Invention, to thoſe Sacred Writings, and thereby to deſtroy their <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> For indeed the whole contexture of the Scriptures, both of the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> do give us ſuch clear No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Spirituality of the Divine Nature, that they cannot be diſtorted, to ſavour any Opinion that is contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, without open violence, as well as ſecret Art and Cunning:</hi> Tho it muſt be confeſſed at the ſame time, that they teach ſome things above our Reaſon, be cauſe they came from an Author who knows more than in this Life can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by us.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:109220:97"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> If you rightly underſtand the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guities of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, which my Author very learnedly reckons up, in the 93. <hi>Pag.</hi> and the great want we have of a certain Hiſtory of the Books themſelves, and the Lives of the Authors, you would eaſily perceive that we know little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the true ſence of Scriptures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in thoſe places which treat of <hi>Moral Precepts,</hi> for they are ſo plainly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, that they retain the ſame perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity in all Languages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> We know that the Hebrew, as well as all other Languages, is ſubject to ſome Ambiguities, which may create Error, but we do not ſee that theſe Ambiguities are ſo frequent, or of ſuch conſequence, as to ſhake our Belief of any one Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article of Revealed Religion. But with what Gygantick confidence, would your Aurhor raiſe a Stupendious ſtructure, upon this narrow and rotten Foundation? There are ſome ambiguities, in ſome places, that may ſometimes ariſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true meaning of ſome few Texts of Scripture—Therefore we can never be certain of the true meaning of any one Text therein, thoſe only excepted, which contain Moral Precepts, for of thoſe we were certain before hand. But we can never underſtand, from thence, that there
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:109220:98"/> was ſuch a People as the <hi>Jews,</hi> or ſuch a man as <hi>Moſes,</hi> or ſuch a Perſon as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who did wonderful things in <hi>Judea,</hi> nor any Apoſtles ſent out by him, for theſe are all ſpeculative matters, which (tho the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was wrote in <hi>Greek,</hi> yet) are altogether obſcured by the ambiguities of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language. Can you think your Author would have deſcended to this abſurd way of arguing, if his cauſe would have bore a better? Is not our Faith on our Saviour, grounded upon plain Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch Matters of Fact, as are as eaſily intelligible in one Language as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and will not Hiſtory as well bear a Tranſlation as the Problems of <hi>Euclid?</hi> Does not he pretend to expound Scripture by ſome <hi>Hebrew</hi> Hiſtory, (if he could get one for his purpoſe) and yet is all Hiſtory ſo obſcure, that it is impoſſible to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You cannot deny, but that a Hiſtory of the Lives of the Prophets, would much conduce towards the better underſtanding of Prophetical Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> It might give light to ſome few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but is far from being abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to expound all. Why may we not as well underſtand the Scriptures, without ſuch a Hiſtory, as the works of <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Levy?</hi> Beſides, in what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109220:98"/> muſt this Expounding Hiſtory be wrote? Not in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for then it muſt be ſubject to the ſame ambiguities, as the Bible it ſelf—Nor in any of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Tongues, for then the matter would not be much mended; Nor in any Foreign dialect, for then it would not paſs for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, as wrote by one not skill'd in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Affairs. Then by whom muſt this Hiſtory be wrote? By an Author that pretends to be inſpired, then <hi>Spinoſa</hi> will have the ſame prejudice againſt him, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other Prophets, and Pen-men of the Holy Scripture, whom he expoſes as Mad-Men, and will not allow them to ſay one thing, (unleſs in Morals) that can be underſtood, or that ought to be believed by us: If this Hiſtory is wrote by an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that pretends to no Inſpiration, tho that one thing might recommend him to <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> yet it will give all thinking men juſt cauſe of caution, that they be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon, by a man whom they know to be as fallible as themſelves: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs they can be well ſatisfied, that his integrity is greater, his underſtanding clearer, and his opportunities of knowing all the important Matters of Fact, of thoſe Ages, more advantagious, than thoſe of the Holy Pen-men, they will ſee no reaſon, why they ſhould rather Correct
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:109220:99"/> Scripture by the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> than the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> by Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Ay, but my Author gives you ſuch a Hiſtory of Scripture, as makes all the Pentateuch, Books of <hi>Joſhua, Judges,</hi> &amp;c. To appear to be a Novel Invention, moſt likely to be jumbled together by <hi>Eſdras,</hi> as he well Conjectures, and that the other Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> received as Canonical, are not of that Antiquity which you Divines aſcribe to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> But then you ſhould conſider, that your Author is a Perſon upon whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we cannot rely, ſince we can have no reaſon to be ſatisfy'd with the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Authority of ſuch an <hi>Hiſtorian.</hi> How little his integrity is, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen, by his pretending to be a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> and to advance the Law of Nature, which conſiſts chiefly in Loving God; when it is plain from his Chapter of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that he is really an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt needs be, that holds the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and immutability of the Power of Nature: As alſo by his partial Diſtorture of Scripture, by denying it the ſame liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of uſing words in a Tranſlated ſenſe, which is given to all other Writings. As for clearneſs of Judgment, which is the ſecond Commendation of an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> I cannot ſee how your Author can pretend
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109220:99"/> to that, whom I have ſhew'd, to have laid down ſo many falſe propoſitions, drawn ſo many falſe concluſions, and ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have contradicted himſelf. And as for his opportunities of knowing the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, of the moſt grand importance of thoſe Ages, we all know, that he is as ignorant of them as our ſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had rather believe thoſe who liv'd in Ancient times, and were Eye-Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of what our Saviour did, or ſuffered for our ſakes, than a Modern upſtart, whom we are ſure can underſtand, at moſt, no more than our ſelves of the matter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> But tho you ſlight his Authority, yet if he can prove by ſolid reaſons, as he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in his 8th Chapter, <hi>That the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch was not wrote by</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You are bound to yield to them, and to deny its Divine Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> But if his Reaſons, are fallacious, and Conjectural (as I could eaſily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, had we Books and leiſure in this place, to go through the Argument, which yet at beſt would be but loſs of time) then you cannot blame me, if I withdraw my aſſent from his Pernicious Doctrines. But to bring matters to a ſhort iſſue. Do you believe, that the Account the Evangeliſts give of the Life of our Saviour, and the Acts of his Apoſtles, is altogether unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:109220:100"/> by the <hi>Hebriaſms,</hi> and various Lections?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> No, I think no man of common ſenſe or modeſty, will pretend to ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Do you think, that all therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of them, could be done by any Natural, or Diabolical Power?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You have already demonſtrated the impoſſibility of the firſt, and the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſecond aſſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Then if our <hi>S.</hi> and his Apoſtles, who prov'd their own Divine Miſſion, did bear Teſtimony to the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other Prophets, all your Authors Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms, or Conjectural fancies of <hi>Eſaras, Vaniſh into nothing.</hi> For with what truth could our Saviour have ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> the 19th and the 7th. <hi>That</hi> Moſes <hi>Commanded to give a Bill of Divorcement, and that</hi> Moſes, <hi>for the hardneſs of their Hearts, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them to put away their Wives?</hi> or St. John 19. 17. <hi>That the Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>if the whole Pentateuch had been a Fiction of</hi> Eſdras? <hi>Our Saviour therefore has confirm'd the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Divine Authority of the</hi> Old Teſtament, <hi>by a new addition of Signs and Wonders, impoſſible to be gainſaid by the Cunning, or Malice of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> You have now given me full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, concerning the Divine Authority
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:109220:100"/> of the Scriptures, into a diſlike of which I was led by the Sophiſtry of this intriegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Author. For it mightily pleas'd me, to hear his project, to deduce all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from Natural reaſon, which as he teaches, <hi>p.</hi> 98. Proceeds from plain and obvious Notions, to the moſt obſcure and remoteſt objects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> Let Natural reaſon proceed never ſo cautiouſly, yet ſhe can never aſcend ſo high, as to underſtand clearly thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural things which concern a future State, of which ſhe has here, no compleat <hi>Ideas.</hi> And beſides, if God is a free Agent, it follows, he can preſcribe what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſalvation do beſt pleaſe him: And Natural reaſon can never aſcend to the knowledge of what a free Agent will have done, from any known or obvious Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims in Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> No more than one man, by reaſon alone, can tell what is the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of another—But I will ask you one Queſtion more, <hi>Viz.</hi> Who ought to be the Interpreter of Scripture? <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> The ambiguous uſe of the word In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, has been the cauſe of much Error, and much Miſchief in the World, it is a Multiplied <hi>Idea,</hi> which will breed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109220:101"/> confuſion in the underſtanding, if it be not carefully reſolved into its firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. For firſt, ſometimes to interpret Scripture, is put to ſignify only, a right apprehenſion of what is the true ſenſe of Scripture, and an expreſſion of that true ſenſe, in plain and proper terms: And this belongs to every individual Man, to whom the Goſpel is Preached. For every man has a right to underſtand thoſe truths that are a-like beneficial to all mankind, and which are therefore promulged, that they may be made known unto all: And as every man has a right to underſtand as much as he can of Divine truths, ſo alſo may be Communicate that knowledge by Speech to others, tho the publick Exerciſe of that Office, do moſt properly belong to the Miniſters of God. But others, by the word Interpret, do underſtand, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of affixing what ſenſe they pleaſe upon the Scriptures, and conſtraining others to admit the ſame, be it what it will, as true and genuine. But ſuch an Authority as this, can neither belong to every Private man, nor to any humane Power whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For no man can have Authority from the God of Truth, to oppoſe truth it ſelf, and it is groſs non-ſenſe, to call Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Scripture, an Interpretation of it. There is no room for Interpretation,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109220:101"/> but in places that are obſcure and dubious, but plain Texts expound themſelves, and to pretend that every man has a right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of affixing a contradictory ſenſe, to the moſt eaſy, expreſs, and intelligible Texts of Scripture, is as much as to ſay, <hi>Every Man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Summum jus. ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas.</note> 
                  <hi>has a right to be a Fool, and to deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to live in Error, and be nurſt up in the ignorance of thoſe things, that moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Happineſs, and to give the Lye to his great Creator.</hi> Inſtead of believing the Scriptures, to be the Word of God, every private man, according to your Authors Hypotheſis, may believe them lawfully to be the invention of Sathan, or the dictates of Mad-men, or the invention of ſome cunning <hi>Politicians.</hi> What is more plain than our Saviours words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17.

               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe a man diſcourſing upon theſe words, ſhould pretend to teach from hence, that no Goſpel either was, is, or ever ought to be Preached to the World; <hi>That no man ought to believe that Jeſus is the</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>and that there is no Condemnation to unbelievers either in this World, or in the World to come.</hi> Would you call this an Interpretation of that Text of Scripture?</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:109220:102"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Not if I was in my right Senſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> And yet your prodigal Author gives this large Authority to every private Man, of Interpreting Scripture after this abſurd, and erroneous manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Perhaps, he only means, <hi>it is in every Man's Power to Interpret Scripture as he pleaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> So it is in every Man's power to be Erroneous, and to Act contrary to the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> but has he therefore a right <hi>to Murder, Steal, or commit Adultery?</hi> But he does not only ſay, <hi>Summum jus libere ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiendi de Religione penes unumquemque eſſe,</hi> but, <hi>Summam Authoritatem Scripturam</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Methinks the right of Interpreting Scripture, ought rather to be given to ſome Body of Men, who are moſt likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L.</hi> I have already ſhew'd you, <hi>That Contradiction is no Interpretation,</hi> and, <hi>that no Humane power, can have Authority to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Divine Revelation,</hi> unleſs you could prove, <hi>That Man is more Omniſcient than God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> God forbid, that I ſhould attempt that; for now I begin to hate the very name of <hi>Deiſm,</hi> as it ſtands Oppoſed to the Belief of <hi>Revealed Religion.</hi>
